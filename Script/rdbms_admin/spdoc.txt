0.  Introduction and Terminology
--------------------------------

To effectively perform reactive tuning, it is vital to have an established 
baseline for later comparison when the system is running poorly.  Without 
a baseline data point, it becomes very difficult to identify what a new 
problem is attributable to:  Has the volume of transactions on the system 
increased?  Has the transaction profile or application changed?  Has the 
number of users increased?

Statspack fundamentally differs from the well known UTLBSTAT/UTLESTAT 
tuning scripts by collecting more information, and also by storing the 
performance statistics permanently in Oracle tables, which can later
be used for reporting and analysis.  The data collected can be analyzed 
using the report provided, which includes an 'instance health and load' 
summary page, high resource SQL statements, as well as the traditional 
wait events and initialization parameters.

Statspack improves on the existing UTLBSTAT/UTLESTAT performance scripts 
in the following ways:

  - Statspack collects more data, including high resource SQL
    (and the optimizer execution plans for those statements)

  - Statspack pre-calculates many ratios useful when performance
    tuning, such as cache hit ratios, per transaction and per 
    second statistics (many of these ratios must be calculated 
    manually when using BSTAT/ESTAT)

  - Permanent tables owned by PERFSTAT store performance statistics; 
    instead of creating/dropping tables each time, data is inserted 
    into the pre-existing tables.  This makes historical data
    comparisons easier

  - Statspack separates the data collection from the report generation.
    Data is collected when a 'snapshot' is taken; viewing the data 
    collected is in the hands of the performance engineer when he/she
    runs the performance report

  - Data collection is easy to automate using either dbms_job or an 
    OS utility


  NOTE:  The term 'snapshot' is used to denote a set of statistics gathered
         at a single time, identified by a unique Id which includes the 
         snapshot number (or snap_id).  This term should not be confused 
         with Oracle's Snapshot Replication technology.


How does Statspack work?

Statspack is a set of SQL, PL/SQL and SQL*Plus scripts which allow the 
collection, automation, storage and viewing of performance data.  A user 
is automatically created by the installation script - this user, PERFSTAT, 
owns all objects needed by this package.  This user is granted limited 
query-only privileges on the V$views required for performance tuning.

Statspack users will become familiar with the concept of a 'snapshot'.
'snapshot' is the term used to identify a single collection of
performance data.  Each snapshot taken is identified by a 'snapshot id' 
which is a unique number generated at the time the snapshot is taken; 
each time a new collection is taken, a new snap_id is generated.  

The snap_id, along with the database identifier (dbid) and instance number 
(instance_number) comprise the unique key for a snapshot (using this
unique combination allows storage of multiple instances of a Clustered
database in the same tables).

Once snapshots are taken, it is possible to run the performance report.
The performance report will prompt for the two snapshot id's the report
will process.  The report produced calculates the activity on the instance
between the two snapshot periods specified, in a similar way to the 
BSTAT/ESTAT report; to compare - the first snap_id supplied can be 
considered the equivalent of running BSTAT; the second snap_id 
specified can be considered the equivalent of ESTAT.  Unlike BSTAT/ESTAT 
which can by its nature only compare two static data points, the report 
can compare any two snapshots specified.



1.  Enterprise Manager (EM), Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) and Statspack
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enterprise Manager
------------------
Statspack allows you to capture Oracle instance-related performance data, and 
report on this data in a textual format.

For EM managed databases in 9i, Oracle Enterprise Manager uses Statspack data 
and displays it graphically.  Starting with 10g, Enterprise Manager instead
uses data collected by the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR).  AWR
data is internally captured and stored by Oracle 10g databases.

For more information about Oracle Enterprise Manager visit the Oracle website
oracle.com --> Database --> Manageability 

Automatic Workload Repository and Statspack
-------------------------------------------
The Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) is an integrated part of the Oracle 
server.  Its purpose is to collect server-related performance data 
automatically every 60 minutes (by default) when the statistics_level 
parameter is set to 'typical' (or 'all').  As the data is collected by the 
server itself, the Automated Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM) component of
the server uses this data automatically to diagnose performance issues.  
DBAs and performance engineers can access the performance recommendations
by using EM, or view the captured data in the AWR report, which is similar to 
the Statspack Instance report.

To compare, Statspack is a manually installed and configured set of SQL and 
PL/SQL scripts which gather performance statistics.  The data gathered
is used by DBAs and performance engineers to manually diagnose performance 
problems.

The AWR schema was initially based on the Statspack schema, but has since been
modified.  Because of this shared history, there are some similarities
(e.g. concept of a snapshot, similar base tables).  However, AWR is 
separate from Statspack.

For more information on using AWR, please see the Oracle 10g Server 
Performance Tuning Guide.  For license information regarding AWR, please
see the Oracle database Licensing Information Manual.

If you are going to use AWR instead of Statspack, and you have been using
Statspack at your site, it is recommended that you continue to capture 
Statspack data for a short time (e.g. one month) after the upgrade to 10g.  
This is because comparing post-upgrade Statspack data to pre-upgrade Statspack
data may make diagnosing initial upgrade problems easier to detect.

  WARNING:  If you choose to continue Statspack data collection after
            upgrading to 10g, and statistics_level is set to typical or
            all (which enables AWR collection), it is advised to stagger
            Statspack data collection so it does not coincide with AWR
            data collection (AWR data collection is by default is every
            hour, on the hour).  Staggering data collection should be done 
            to avoid the potential for any interference (e.g. stagger data 
            collection by 30 minutes).

Long term, typically, there is little reason to collect data through both
AWR and Statspack.  If you choose to use AWR instead of Statspack, you should
ensure you should keep a representative set of baselined Statspack data for 
future reference.



2.  Statspack Configuration
---------------------------

2.1.  Database Space Requirements

  The amount of database space required by the package will vary considerably
  based on the frequency of snapshots, the size of the database and instance,
  and the amount of data collected (which is configurable).
 
  It is therefore difficult to provide general storage clauses and space 
  utilization predictions that will be accurate at each site.

  Space Requirements
  ------------------
  The default initial and next extent sizes are 100k, 1MB, 3MB or 5MB for all 
  Statspack tables and indexes.  To install Statspack, the minimum 
  space requirement is approximately 100MB.  However, the amount of space
  actually allocated will depend on the Tablespace storage characteristics
  of the tablespace Statspack is installed in (for example, if your minimum
  extent size is 10m, then the storage requirement will be considerably more
  than 100m).

  Using Locally Managed Tablespaces
  ---------------------------------
  If you install the package in a locally-managed tablespace, such as 
  SYSAUX, modifying storage clauses is not required, as the storage 
  characteristics are automatically managed.

  Using Dictionary Managed Tablespaces
  ------------------------------------
  If you install the package in a dictionary-managed tablespace, Oracle
  suggests you monitor the space used by the objects created, and adjust
  the storage clauses of the segments, if required.


2.2.  Installing the Tool

    Installation scripts create a user called PERFSTAT, which will own all
    PL/SQL code and database objects created (including the STATSPACK tables, 
    constraints and the STATSPACK package).

    During the installation you will be prompted for the PERFSTAT 
    user's password and default and temporary tablespaces.

    The default tablespace will be used to create all Statspack
    objects (such as tables and indexes).  Oracle recommend using the
    SYSAUX tablespace for the PERFSTAT user's default tablespace; the
    SYSAUX tablespace will be the tablespace defaulted during the
    installation, if no other is specified.

    A temporary tablespace is used for workarea activities, such 
    as sorting (for more information on temporary tablespaces, see 
    the Oracle10g Concepts Manual).  The Statspack user's temporary 
    tablespace will be set to the database's default temporary tablespace
    by the installation, if no other temporary tablespace is specified.

      NOTE:
      o  A password for PERFSTAT user is mandatory and there is no default
         password; if a password is not specified, the installation will
         abort with an error indicating this is the problem.

      o  For security reasons, keep PERFSTAT's password confidential.

      o  Do not specify the SYSTEM tablespace for the PERFSTAT users
         DEFAULT or TEMPORARY tablespaces; if SYSTEM is specified the
         installation will terminate with an error indicating this is the
         problem.  This is enforced as Oracle does not recommend using 
         the SYSTEM tablespace to store statistics data, nor for workareas.
         Use the SYSAUX (or a TOOLS) tablespace to store the data, and 
         your instance's TEMPORARY tablespace for workareas.

      o  During the installation, the dbms_shared_pool PL/SQL package
         is created.  dbms_shared_pool is used to pin the Statspack 
         package in the shared pool
         dbms_job is no longer created as part of the installation, as
         it is already created by catproc.sql (dbms_job can be used by 
         the DBA to schedule periodic snapshots automatically).


    To install the package, either change directory to the ORACLE_HOME
    rdbms/admin directory, or fully specify the ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin
    directory when calling the installation script, spcreate.

    To run the installation script, you must use SQL*Plus and connect as
    a user with SYSDBA privilege.

    e.g.  Start SQL*Plus, then:
      on Unix:
        SQL>  connect / as sysdba
        SQL>  @?/rdbms/admin/spcreate

      on Windows:
        SQL>  connect / as sysdba
        SQL>  @%ORACLE_HOME%\rdbms\admin\spcreate


    The spcreate install script runs 3 other scripts - you do not need to 
    run these - these scripts are called automatically:
      1.  spcusr  ->  creates the user and grants privileges
      2.  spctab  ->  creates the tables
      3.  spcpkg  ->  creates the package

    Check each of the three output files produced (spcusr.lis,
    spctab.lis, spcpkg.lis) by the installation to ensure no 
    errors were encountered, before continuing on to the next step.

    Note that there are two ways to install Statspack - interactively (as
    shown above), or in 'batch' mode; batch mode is useful when you do 
    not wish to be prompted for the PERFSTAT user's password, and default 
    and temporary tablespaces.


      Batch mode installation
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      To install in batch mode, you must assign values to the SQL*Plus
      variables which specify the password and the default and temporary
      tablespaces before running spcreate.

      The variables are:
        perfstat_password    -> for the password
        default_tablespace   -> for the default tablespace
        temporary_tablespace -> for the temporary tablespace

      e.g.
        on Unix:
          SQL>  connect / as sysdba
          SQL>  define default_tablespace='tools'
          SQL>  define temporary_tablespace='temp'
          SQL>  define perfstat_password='erg8oiw'
          SQL>  @?/rdbms/admin/spcreate
          SQL>  undefine perfstat_password

      spcreate will no longer prompt for the above information.


2.3.  Errors during installation

  Specifying SYSTEM tablespace
    A possible error during installation is to specify the SYSTEM
    tablespace for the PERFSTAT user's DEFAULT or TEMPORARY tablespace.
    In such a situation, the installation will fail, stating the problem.

  To install Statspack after receiving errors during the installation
    To correctly install Statspack after such errors, first run the 
    de-install script, then the install script.  Both scripts must be 
    run from SQL*Plus.

    e.g.  Start SQL*Plus, connect as a user with SYSDBA privilege, then:
       SQL> @spdrop
       SQL> @spcreate



3.  Gathering data - taking a snapshot
--------------------------------------

The simplest interactive way to take a snapshot is to login to SQL*Plus
as the PERFSTAT user, and execute the procedure statspack.snap:
    e.g.
      SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
      SQL>  execute statspack.snap;

  Note:  In a Clustered database environment, you must connect to the 
         instance you wish to collect data for.

This will store the current values for the performance statistics
in the Statspack tables, and can be used as a baseline snapshot
for comparison with another snapshot taken at a later time.

For better performance analysis, set the initialization parameter 
timed_statistics to true;  this way, Statspack data collected will include 
important timing information.  The timed_statistics parameter is also 
dynamically changeable using the 'alter system' command.  Timing data is 
important and is usually required by Oracle support to diagnose performance 
problems.

The default level of data collection is level 5.  It is possible to change
the amount of data captured by changing the snapshot level, and the default
thresholds used by Statspack.  For information on how to do this, please see
the 'Configuring the amount of data captured' section of this file.

Typically, in the situation where you would like to automate the gathering
and reporting phases (such as during a benchmark), you may need to know the
snap_id of the snapshot just taken.  To take a snapshot and display the 
snap_id, call the statspack.snap function.  Below is an example of calling
the snap function using an anonymous PL/SQL block in SQL*Plus:

   e.g. 
     SQL> variable snap number;
     SQL> begin   :snap := statspack.snap;   end;
       2  /
     PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
     SQL> print snap
           SNAP

3.1.  Automating Statspack statistics gathering

  To be able to make comparisons of performance from one day, week or 
  year to the next, there must be multiple snapshots taken over a period 
  of time.

  The best method to gather snapshots is to automate the collection on 
  a regular time interval.  It is possible to do this:

    - within the database, using the Oracle dbms_job procedure to 
      schedule the snapshots

    - using Operating System utilities.  On Unix systems, you could use 
      utilities such as 'cron' or 'at'.  On Windows, you could schedule a 
      task (e.g. via Start> Programs> Accessories> System Tools> 
      Scheduled Tasks).


3.2.  Using dbms_job

  To use an Oracle-automated method for collecting statistics, you can use
  dbms_job.  A sample script on how to do this is supplied in spauto.sql,
  which schedules a snapshot every hour, on the hour.

  You may wish to schedule snapshots at regular times each day to reflect your
  system's OLTP and/or batch peak loads. For example take snapshots at 9am, 
  10am, 11am, 12 midday and 6pm for the OLTP load, then a snapshot at 
  12 midnight and another at 6am for the batch window.

  In order to use dbms_job to schedule snapshots, the job_queue_processes 
  initialization parameter must be set to a value greater than 0 for the job
  to run automatically.

  Example of setting the job_queue_processes parameter in an init.ora file:
    #  Set to enable the job queue process to start.  This allows dbms_job
    #  to schedule automatic statistics collection using STATSPACK
    job_queue_processes=1

  If using spauto.sql in a Clustered database environment, the spauto.sql 
  script must be run once on each instance in the cluster.  Similarly, the 
  job_queue_processes parameter must also be set for each instance.


  Changing the interval of statistics collection
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To change the interval of statistics collection use the dbms_job.interval
  procedure
  e.g.
    execute dbms_job.interval(1,'SYSDATE+(1/48)');

  Where 'SYSDATE+(1/48)' will result in the statistics being gathered each
  1/48th of a day (i.e. every 30 minutes).

  To force the job to run immediately, 
    execute dbms_job.run(<job number>);

  To remove the auto collect job,
    execute dbms_job.remove(<job number>);

  For more information on dbms_job, see the Supplied Packages Reference
  Manual.



4.  Running the Performance reports
-----------------------------------

Once snapshots are taken, it is possible to generate a performance report.
There are two reports available - an Instance report, and a SQL report:

 - The Instance Report (spreport.sql and sprepins.sql)
   is a general instance health report, covering all aspects of instance 
   performance.  The instance report calculates and prints ratios, 
   increases etc. for all statistics between the two snapshot periods, 
   in a similar way to the BSTAT/ESTAT report.

   Note: spreport.sql calls sprepins.sql, first defaulting the dbid and
         instance number of the instance you are connected to.  For more
         information on the difference between sprepins and spreport,
         see the 'Running the instance report when there are multiple 
         instances' section of this document.

 - The SQL report (sprepsql.sql and sprsqins.sql)
   is a report for a specific SQL statement.  The SQL report is usually 
   run after examining the high-load SQL sections of the instance health 
   report.  The SQL report provides detailed statistics and data for a 
   single SQL statement (as identified by the Hash Value).

   Note: sprepsql.sql calls sprsqins.sql, first defaulting the dbid and
         instance number of the instance you are connected to.  For more
         information on the difference between sprsqins and sprepsql,
         see the 'Running the SQL report when there are multiple instances' 
         section of this document.

Both reports prompt for the beginning snapshot id, the ending snapshot id,
and the report name.  The SQL report additionally requests the Hash Value
for the SQL statement to be reported on.

  Note:  It is not correct to specify begin and end snapshots where the
         begin snapshot and end snapshot were taken from different
         instance startups.  In other words, the instance must not have 
         been shutdown between the times that the begin and end snapshots 
         were taken.
         The reason for this requirement is the database's dynamic 
         performance tables which Statspack queries to gather the data 
         are memory resident, hence shutting down the database will 
         reset the values in the performance tables to 0.  As Statspack 
         subtracts the begin-snapshot statistics from the end-snapshot
         statistics, the resulting output will be invalid.
         If begin and end snapshots which were taken between shutdowns 
         are specified in the report, an appropriate error is signaled
         and the report exits.

Separating the phase of data gathering from producing a report, allows the 
flexibility of basing a report on any data points selected.  For example 
it may be reasonable for the DBA to use the supplied automation script to 
automate data collection every hour on the hour; If at some later point 
a performance issue arose which may be better investigated by looking 
at a three hour data window rather than an hour's worth of data, the 
only thing the DBA need do, is specify the required start point and end 
point when running the report.

The majority of cases, you will only need to read the following sections 
of this document, to run the reports:
  Running the instance report
  Running the SQL report
  Gathering optimizer statistics on the PERFSTAT schema

If your database is a Real Application Clusters database, you may also benefit
from reading:
  Running the instance report when there are multiple instances
  Running the SQL report when there are multiple instances

If you would like a greater degree of configuration in the report output, you 
may also be interested in reading:

  Configuring the SQL report


4.1.  Running the instance report

  To examine the change in instance-wide statistics between two time periods, 
  the spreport.sql file is executed while being connected to the PERFSTAT 
  user.  The spreport.sql command file is located in the rdbms/admin 
  directory of the Oracle Home.

  This report assumes you are connected to the database you wish to report
  on.  In a clustered database environment (RAC), you must connect to the 
  instance you wish to report on when running spreport.sql.  To avoid 
  this, see the 'Running the instance report when there are multiple 
  instances' section of this document.

  When running spreport, you will be prompted for:
    1. The beginning snapshot Id
    2. The ending    snapshot Id
    3. The name of the report text file to be created

  Note:  Blank lines between lines of snapshot Id's means the instance 
         has been restarted (shutdown/startup) between those times - 
         this helps identify which begin and end snapshots can be used
         together when running a Statspack report (ones separated by
         a blank line can not).

         By default, the report shows all completed snapshots for this instance
         when choosing the begin and end snapshot Id's.  However, the number 
         of days worth of snapshots to list is now configurable: to change 
         this, please see 'Snapshot related report settings - num_days' in the
         'Configuring the Instance Report' section of this document.

    e.g. on Unix
      SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
      SQL>  @?/rdbms/admin/spreport

    e.g. on Windows
      SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
      SQL>  @%ORACLE_HOME%\rdbms\admin\spreport
   

    Example output:
    SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
    Connected.
    SQL>  @spreport

  The report will now scroll past, and also be written to the file
  specified (e.g. sp_1_2.lis).


      Batch mode report generation
      ----------------------------
      To run a report without being prompted, assign values to the 
      SQL*Plus variables which specify the begin snap id, the end snap id
      and the report name before running spreport.

      The variables are:
        begin_snap   -> specifies the begin Snapshot Id
        end_snap     -> specifies the end   Snapshot Id
        report_name  -> specifies the Report output name

      e.g.
        on Unix:
          SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
          SQL>  define begin_snap=1
          SQL>  define end_snap=2
          SQL>  define report_name=batch_run
          SQL>  @?/rdbms/admin/spreport

      spreport will no longer prompt for the above information.


4.2. Running the instance report when there are multiple instances

  spreport.sql assumes you are connected to the database you wish to report
  on.  There are certain situations where this assumption may not be
  valid:

   - In a clustered database environment (RAC), you may be connected to
     an instance which is not the instance you wish to report on

   - If you are archiving baseline Statspack data in a separate database
     from your production database, or when importing Statspack data
     (e.g. in the case of Oracle support)

  In these situations, you would not be able to produce the Statspack
  instance report using spreport.sql, as the instance assumed may be 
  unavailable, possibly on a totally different host.

  To circumvent this problem, you should run the sprepins.sql report
  instead.  The sprepins.sql report output is identical to the
  spreport.sql output, as spreport.sql simply calls sprepins.sql, first 
  defaulting the Instance Number and DBId of the database you are
  currently connected to.

  If you run sprepins.sql directly, you are prompted for the DBId and
  Instance Number for the instance you wish to report on, in addition
  to the begin_snap and end_snap Ids and report output name (i.e. the 
  current DBId and Instance Number are not defaulted).

  Note:  By default, the report shows all completed snapshots for this instance
         when choosing the begin and end snapshot Id's.  However, the number 
         of days worth of snapshots to list is now configurable: to change 
         this, please see 'Snapshot related report settings - num_days' in the
         'Configuring the Instance Report' section of this document.


  You will be prompted for:

    1. The DBId
    2. The Instance Number
    3. The beginning snapshot Id
    4. The ending    snapshot Id
    5. The name of the report text file to be created

    Example output:
    SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
    Connected.
    SQL>  @sprepins
 

Instances in this Statspack schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   DB Id    Inst Num DB Name      Instance     Host
----------- -------- ------------ ------------ ------------

Enter value for dbid: 4290976145
Using 4290976145 for database Id
Enter value for inst_num: 1
....

  Then similarly to spreport, the available snapshots are displayed, 
  and the begin and end snaps and report name are prompted for.


      Batch mode report generation
      ----------------------------
      To run the sprepins.sql report without being prompted, assign values 
      to the SQL*Plus variables which specify the dbid, instance number,
      begin snap id, the end snap id, and the report name, before running 
      spreport.

      The variables are:
        dbid         -> specifies the dbid
        inst_num     -> specifies the instance number
        begin_snap   -> specifies the begin Snapshot Id
        end_snap     -> specifies the end   Snapshot Id
        report_name  -> specifies the Report output name

      e.g.
          SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
          SQL>  define dbid=4290976145
          SQL>  define inst_num=1
          SQL>  define begin_snap=1
          SQL>  define end_snap=2
          SQL>  define report_name=batch_run
          SQL>  @?/rdbms/admin/sprepins

      sprepins will no longer prompt for the above information.


4.3. Configuring the Instance Report

  It is now possible to configure some aspects of the Statspack Instance
  report output.  These are discussed below.

  For the majority of sites, the only variable which should be modified (if
  required) is num_days.  The remaining variables have been documented solely 
  for benchmarks, or for sites who have very specific application requirements.

  Note:  Modifying the default value of any variable other than num_days
         may result in useful data being excluded from the report.  Please
         be very cautious when choosing values for the remaining variables.

         Backup the original Statspack report (sprepins.sql) to a different 
         file name before making changes to the file.  Once the changes
         have been made, backup the newly modified report.  As this file
         will be replaced when the server is upgraded to a new release, you
         will need to make the same changes to this file each time the 
         server is upgraded.

  The configuration is performed by modifying the 'Customer Configurable
  Report Settings' section of the file sprepins.sql for the instance report
  (and for num_days, sprsqins.sql for the SQL report).


  Snapshot related report settings - num_days
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The number of days of snapshots to list when displaying the snapshots 
  to choose the begin and end snapshot Ids from.  The default is to list
  all snapshots.  However it is now possible to configure the number of 
  days worth of snapshots to list.

  This facility has been added for sites that have a large number of snapshots 
  stored in the Statspack schema, and who typically only look at the last
  <n> days worth of data.

  For example, setting the number of days of snapshots to list (num_days) to
  31 would result in the most recent 31 days worth of snapshots being listed
  when choosing the begin and end snapshot Ids.

  Note:  This variable is the only variable modifiable in both the instance 
         report (sprepins.sql) and the SQL report (sprsqins.sql).

  The value of this variable is configured by changing the value assigned to
  the variable num_days.
  e.g.
        define num_days = 60

  The variable has the following valid values:

    <null>      - When a null string is used, all snapshots will be displayed.
                  This is the default setting.
                  e.g.  
                        define num_days = ''

    <n>         - Where n is the number of days of snapshots to list.
                  e.g. to set the number of days of snapshots to list to 31,
                  set num_days to 31:
                        define num_days = 31

    0           - A value of 0 means do not print out any snapshots.
                  This value would be of most use for batch execution of
                  the instance report, where the values for begin snap id and
                  end snap id are already known, thus printing out a list to
                  choose from is unneeded.
                  e.g.
                        define num_days = 0

    <undefined> - This means the parameter is commented out in (or totally 
                  removed from) the file sprepins.sql
                  An undefined value for num_days will result in the report
                  prompting you for the number of days to enter, interactively.
                  Using '--' before the 'define' comments out the definition
                  of the variable, thus leaving it undefined.
                  e.g.
                       -- define num_days=31
                  Choosing this setting as your site's default means the 
                  instance report cannot be run in batch mode.

  If num_days is set to any value other than <undefined>, you will not be
  prompted to enter a value.  However, if the variable is set to <undefined>
  running the instance report (or the SQL report) will result in you 
  being prompted for the value, as follows:

Current Instance

Using          1 for instance number


Specify the number of days of snapshots to choose from
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Entering the number of days (n) will result in the most recent
(n) days of snapshots being listed.  Pressing <return> without
specifying a number lists all completed snapshots.

Enter value for num_days: 5

Specify the Begin and End Snapshot Ids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enter value for begin_snap: 
....


  SQL section report settings - top_n_sql
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Total number of rows of SQL output to display in each SQL section of the 
  report.  Note this is not related to a specific SQL statement, nor to the 
  total number of SQL statements, merely to the maximum number of lines 
  outputted for each separate SQL section of the report.
  The default value is 65.  To change the value, change the value of the 
  variable top_n_sql.
  e.g.
        define top_n_sql = 65;

  SQL section report settings - num_rows_per_hash
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This is the upper limit of the number of rows of SQL Text to print for 
  each SQL statement appearing in the SQL sections of the report.  This 
  variable applies to each SQL statement (i.e. hash_value).  The default value
  is 4, which means at most 4 lines  of the SQL text will be printed for 
  each SQL statement.  To change this value, change the value of the variable 
  num_rows_per_hash.
  e.g.
        define num_rows_per_hash = 10;

  SQL section report settings - top_pct_sql
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This is a number which restricts the rows of SQL shown in the SQL sections  
  of the report.  Only SQL statements which exceeded top_pct_sql percentage
  of resources used, are candidates for listing in the report.
  The default value is 1.0%  To change the default, change the value of the
  variable top_pct_sql.
  e.g. 
        define top_pct_sql = 0.5;

  In the SQL ordered by gets section of the report, a top_pct_sql of 0.5% would
  only include SQL statements which had exceeded 0.5% of the total buffer gets
  in the interval.


  Segment related report settings - top_n_segstat
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The number of top segments to display in each of the Segment sections of 
  the instance report.
  The default value is 5, which means only the top 5 segments in each category
  (e.g. top 5 logical reads) will be displayed.  To change the default, 
  change the value of the variable top_n_segstat.
  e.g. 
         define top_n_segstat = 5;


4.4. Running the SQL report

  Once the instance report has been analyzed, often there are high-load SQL
  statements which should be examined to determine if they are causing 
  unnecessary resource usage, and hence avoidable load.

  The SQL report sprepsql.sql, displays SQL-specific statistics, the 
  complete SQL text and (if level 6 snapshot has been taken), information 
  on any SQL Plan(s) associated with that statement.

  The SQL statement to be reported on is identified by the statement's Hash
  Value (which is a numerical representation of the statement's SQL text).
  The Hash Value for each statement is displayed in the high-load SQL
  sections of the instance report.

  The sprepsql.sql file is executed while being connected to the PERFSTAT 
  user, and is located in the rdbms/admin directory of the Oracle Home.

  Note:  To run sprepsql.sql in a Cluster environment, you must connect 
         to the instance you wish to report on.

  You will be prompted for:
    1. The beginning snapshot Id
    2. The ending    snapshot Id
    3. The Hash Value for the SQL statement
    4. The name of the report text file to be created

    Example output:
    SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
    Connected.
    SQL>  @sprepsql

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The default report file name is sp_39_40_1988538571.  To use this name,
press <return> to continue, otherwise enter an alternative.
Enter value for report_name: 

Using the report name sp_39_40_1988538571
....

  The report will scroll past, and also be written to the file
  specified (e.g. sp_39_40_1988538571.lis).


      Batch mode report generation
      ----------------------------
      Similarly to spreport.sql, the SQL report can be run in batch mode.
      To run a report without being prompted, assign values to the 
      SQL*Plus variables which specify the begin snap id, the end snap id,
      the SQL hash value, and the report name before running spreport.

      The variables are:
        begin_snap   -> specifies the begin Snapshot Id
        end_snap     -> specifies the end   Snapshot Id
        hash_value   -> specifies the Hash Value
        report_name  -> specifies the Report output name

      e.g.
          SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
          SQL>  define begin_snap=39
          SQL>  define end_snap=40
          SQL>  define hash_value=1988538571
          SQL>  define report_name=batch_sql_run
          SQL>  @sprepsql

      sprepsql will no longer prompt for the above information.


4.5.  Running the SQL report when there are multiple instances

  sprepsql.sql assumes you are connected to the database you wish to report
  on.  There are certain situations where this assumption may not be
  valid:

   - In a clustered database environment (RAC), you may be connected to
     an instance which is not the instance you wish to report on

   - If you are archiving baseline Statspack data in a separate database
     from your production database, or when importing Statspack data
     (e.g. in the case of Oracle support)

  In these situations, you would not be able to produce the Statspack
  SQL report using sprepsql.sql, as the instance assumed may be 
  unavailable, possibly on a totally different host.

  To circumvent this problem, you should run the sprsqins.sql report
  instead.  The sprsqins.sql report output is identical to the
  sprepsql.sql output, as sprepsql.sql simply calls sprsqins.sql, first 
  defaulting the Instance Number and DBId of the database you are
  currently connected to.

  If you run sprsqins.sql directly, you are prompted for the DBId and
  Instance Number for the instance you wish to report on, in addition
  to the begin_snap and end_snap Ids, hash value and report output name 
  (i.e. the current DBId and Instance Number are not defaulted).

  Note:  By default, the report shows all completed snapshots for this instance
         when choosing the begin and end snapshot Id's.  However, the number 
         of days worth of snapshots to list is now configurable: to change 
         this, please see 'Snapshot related report settings - num_days' in the
         'Configuring the Instance Report' section of this document.


  You will be prompted for:

    1. The DBId
    2. The Instance Number
    3. The beginning snapshot Id
    4. The ending    snapshot Id
    5. The Hash Value for the SQL statement
    6. The name of the report text file to be created

    Example output:
    SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
    Connected.
    SQL>  @sprsqins

  Then similarly to sprepsql, the available snapshots are displayed, 
  and the begin and end snap Ids, the hash value and report name are 
  prompted for.

      Batch mode report generation
      ----------------------------
      To run the sprsqins.sql report without being prompted, assign values 
      to the SQL*Plus variables which specify the dbid, instance number,
      begin snap id, the end snap id, hash value and the report name, 
      before running sprsqins.

      The variables are:
        dbid         -> specifies the dbid
        inst_num     -> specifies the instance number
        begin_snap   -> specifies the begin Snapshot Id
        end_snap     -> specifies the end   Snapshot Id
        hash_value   -> specifies the Hash Value        
        report_name  -> specifies the Report output name

          SQL>  define report_name=batch_run
          SQL>  @?/rdbms/admin/sprsqins

      sprsqins will no longer prompt for the above information.


4.6. Configuring the SQL report

  It is now possible to configure the number of days of snapshots to view
  when choosing the begin and end snapshot Ids.

  Note:  Backup the original Statspack SQL report (sprsqins.sql) to a 
         different file name before making changes to the file.  Once the 
         changes have been made, backup the newly modified report.  As this 
         file will be replaced when the server is upgraded to a new release, 
         you will need to make the same changes to this file each time the 
         server is upgraded.

  The configuration is performed by modifying the 'Customer Configurable
  Report Settings' section of the file sprsqins.sql.  For details on how
  to modify the number of days of snapshots to view, please see 
  'Snapshot related report settings - num_days' in the 'Configuring the 
  Instance Report' section of this document.


4.7. Gathering Optimizer statistics on the PERFSTAT schema

  For best performance when running the performance reports, Optimizer
  statistics should be gathered on the Statspack schema.

  In 10g, the Oracle server automatically gathers optimizer statistics
  on database segments when the segments become stale.

  If you have disabled this on your site, you should manually collect 
  optimizer statistics for tables and indexes owned by PERFSTAT.  This 
  should be performed whenever significant change in data volumes in 
  PERFSTAT's tables.  To do this, use dbms_stats and specify the PERFSTAT 
  user:

     execute dbms_stats.gather_schema_stats(ownname=>'PERFSTAT',cascade=>true);



5.  Configuring the amount of data captured
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the snapshot level, and the thresholds specified will affect the amount
of data Statspack captures.

5.1. Snapshot Level

  It is possible to change the amount of information gathered by the package,
  by specifying a different snapshot 'level'.  In other words, the level
  chosen (or defaulted) will decide the amount of data collected.
  The higher the snapshot level, the more data is gathered.  The default
  level set by the installation is level 5.

  For typical usage, level 5 snapshot is effective on most sites.  There
  are certain situations when using a level 6 snapshot is beneficial, such
  as when taking a baseline.

  The events listed below are a subset of events which should prompt
  taking a new baseline, using level 6:
  - when taking the first snapshots
  - when a new application is installed, or an application is modified/upgraded
  - after gathering optimizer statistics
  - before and after upgrading

  The various levels are explained in detail 'Snapshot Levels - details'
  section of this document.


5.2. Snapshot SQL thresholds

  There are other parameters which can be configured in addition to the 
  snapshot level.

  These parameters are used as thresholds when collecting data on SQL
  statements; data will be captured on any SQL statements that breach 
  the specified thresholds.

  Snapshot level and threshold information used by the package is stored 
  in the stats$statspack_parameter table.


5.3. Changing the default values for Snapshot Level and SQL Thresholds

  If you wish to, you can change the default parameters used for taking
  snapshots, so that they are tailored to the instance's workload.

  The full list of parameters which can be passed into the 
  modify_statspack_parameter procedure are the same as those for the 
  snap procedure.  These are listed in the 'Input Parameters for the SNAP and
  MODIFY_STATSPACK_PARAMETERS procedures' section of this document.


  Temporarily using new values
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To temporarily use a snapshot level or threshold which is different to
  the instance's default snapshot values, simply specify the required 
  threshold or snapshot level when taking the snapshot.  This value will 
  only be used for immediate snapshot taken - the new value will
  not be saved as the default.

  e.g. Take a single level 6 snapshot (do not save level 6 as the default):
    SQL>  execute statspack.snap(i_snap_level=>6);


  Saving new defaults
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If you wish to save the new value as the instance's default, you can do 
  this either by:

  o  Taking a snapshot, and specifying the new defaults to be saved to the
     database (using statspack.snap, and using the i_modify_parameter
     input variable).

     SQL>  execute statspack.snap - 
           (i_snap_level=>10, i_modify_parameter=>'true');

     Setting the i_modify_parameter value to true will save the new
     thresholds in the stats$statspack_parameter table; these thresholds 
     will be used for all subsequent snapshots.

     If the i_modify_parameter was set to false or if it were omitted, the
     new parameter values would not be saved.  Only the snapshot taken at 
     that point will use the specified values, any subsequent snapshots will
     use the preexisting values in the stats$statspack_parameter table. 

  o  Changing the defaults immediately without taking a snapshot, using the
     statspack.modify_statspack_parameter procedure.  For example to change 
     the snapshot level to 10, and the SQL thresholds for buffer_gets and
     disk_reads, the following statement can be issued:

     SQL>  execute statspack.modify_statspack_parameter - 
            (i_snap_level=>10, i_buffer_gets_th=>10000, i_disk_reads_th=>1000);

     This procedure changes the values permanently, but does not
     take a snapshot.


5.4 Snapshot Levels - details

 Levels  >= 0   General performance statistics
    Statistics gathered:
    This level and any level greater than 0 collects general
    performance statistics, such as: wait statistics, system events, 
    system statistics, rollback segment data, row cache, SGA, background 
    events, session events, lock statistics, buffer pool statistics, 
    latch statistics, resource limit, enqueue statistics, and statistics
    for each of the following, if enabled: automatic undo management,
    buffer cache advisory data, auto PGA memory management, Cluster DB
    statistics.

 Levels  >= 5  Additional data:  SQL Statements
    This level includes all statistics gathered in the lower level(s),
    and additionally gathers the performance data on high resource 
    usage SQL statements.

    In a level 5 snapshot (or above), note that the time required for the 
    snapshot to complete is dependent on the shared_pool_size and on the 
    number of SQL statements in the shared pool at the time the snapshot 
    is taken: the larger the shared pool, the longer the time taken to 
    complete the snapshot.

    SQL 'Thresholds'
       The SQL statements gathered by Statspack are those which exceed one of 
       six predefined threshold parameters:
        - number of executions of the SQL statement            (default 100)
        - number of disk reads performed by the SQL statement  (default 1,000)
        - number of parse calls performed by the SQL statement (default 1,000)
        - number of buffer gets performed by the SQL statement (default 10,000)
        - size of sharable memory used by the SQL statement    (default 1m)
        - version count for the SQL statement                  (default 20)

       The values of each of these threshold parameters are used when 
       deciding which SQL statements to collect - if a SQL statement's 
       resource usage exceeds any one of the above threshold values, it 
       is captured during the snapshot.
 
       The SQL threshold levels used are either those stored in the table 
       stats$statspack_parameter, or by the thresholds specified when 
       the snapshot is taken.

 Levels  >= 6  Additional data:  SQL Plans and SQL Plan usage
    This level includes all statistics gathered in the lower level(s),
    and additionally gathers optimizer execution plans, and plan usage 
    data for each of the high resource usage SQL statements captured.

    A level 6 snapshot gathers information which is invaluable when 
    determining whether the execution plan used for a SQL statement 
    has changed.  Therefore level 6 snapshots should be used 
    whenever there is the possibility a plan may change, such as
    after large data loads, or after gathering new optimizer
    statistics.

    To capture the plan for a SQL statement, the statement must be in the 
    shared pool at the time the snapshot is taken, and must exceed one of
    the SQL thresholds.  To gather plans for all statements in the
    shared pool, you can temporarily specify the executions threshold 
    (i_executions_th) to be zero (0) for those snapshots.  For information 
    on how to do this, see the 'Changing the default values for Snapshot 
    Level and SQL Thresholds' section of this document.

 Levels  >= 7  Additional data:  Segment level statistics
    This level includes all statistics gathered in the lower level(s),
    and additionally gathers the performance data on highly used segments.

    A level 7 snapshot captures Segment-level statistics for segments which 
    are heavily accessed or heavily contended for.

    Segment-level statistics captured are:
       - logical reads
       - db block changes
       - physical reads
       - physical writes
       - physical reads direct
       - physical writes direct
       - global cache cr blocks served *
       - global cache current blocks served *
       - buffer busy waits
       - ITL waits
       - row lock waits

       *  Denotes the Statistic is Real Application Clusters specific.

    There are many uses for segment-specific statistics.  Below are three
    examples:
    - The statistics relating to physical reads and writes can help you 
      decide to modify the physical layout of some segments (or of the 
      tablespaces they reside in).  For example, to better spread the 
      segment IO load, you can add files residing on different disks to a 
      tablespace storing a heavily accessed segment, or you can (re)partition 
      a segment.
    - High numbers of ITL waits for a specific segment may indicate a need to
      change segment storage attributes such as PCTFREE and/or INITRANS.
    - In a Real Application Clusters database, global cache statistics
      make it easy to spot the segments responsible for much of the 
      cross-instance traffic.
 
    Although Statspack captures all segment statistics, it only displays the
    following statistics in the Instance report:
       - logical reads
       - physical reads
       - buffer busy waits
       - ITL waits
       - row lock waits
       - global cache cr blocks served *
       - global cache current blocks served *

    Segment statistics 'Thresholds'
       The segments for which statistics are gathered are those whose 
       statistics exceed one of the following seven threshold parameters:
        - number of logical reads on the segment                (default 10000)
        - number of physical reads on the segment               (default 1000)
        - number of buffer busy waits on the segment            (default 100)
        - number of row lock waits on the segment               (default 100)
        - number of ITL waits on the segment                    (default 100)
        - number of global cache Consistent Read blocks served* (default 1000)
        - number of global cache CUrrent blocks served*         (default 1000)

       The values of each of these thresholds are used when deciding which 
       segments to collect statistics for.  If any segment's statistic value 
       exceeds its corresponding threshold value, all statistics for this 
       segment are captured.

       The threshold levels used are either those stored in the table
       stats$statspack_parameter, or by the thresholds specified when
       the snapshot is taken.
 
 Levels  >= 10 Additional statistics:  Parent and Child latches
    This level includes all statistics gathered in the lower levels, and
    additionally gathers Parent and Child Latch information.  Data 
    gathered at this level can sometimes cause the snapshot to take longer 
    to complete i.e. this level can be resource intensive, and should 
    only be used when advised by Oracle personnel.


5.5.  Specifying a Session Id

  If you would like to gather session statistics and wait events for a 
  particular session (in addition to the instance statistics and wait events),
  it is possible to specify the session id in the call to Statspack.  The 
  statistics gathered for the session will include session statistics, 
  session events and lock activity.  The default behaviour is to not to 
  gather session level statistics.

    SQL>  execute statspack.snap(i_session_id=>3);

  Note that in order for session statistics to be included in the report
  output, the session's serial number (serial#) must be the same in the 
  begin and end snapshot.  If the serial numbers differ, it means the 
  session is not the same session, so it is not valid to generate session 
  statistics.  If the serial numbers differ, the following warning will 
  appear (after the begin/end snapshot has been entered by the user) to 
  signal the session statistics cannot be printed:

    WARNING: SESSION STATISTICS WILL NOT BE PRINTED, as session statistics
    captured in begin and end snapshots are for different sessions
    (Begin Snap sid,serial#: 10,752,  End Snap sid,serial#: 10,754).


5.6.  Input Parameters for the SNAP and MODIFY_STATSPACK_PARAMETERS procedures

   Parameters able to be passed in to the statspack.snap and
   statspack.modify_statspack_parameter procedures are as follows:

                    Range of      Default

6.  DB time, and Time Units used for Performance Statistics

----------------------------------------------

6.1.  DB time compared to Total Call Time

  DB time is a statistic manintained by the database, and was introduced
  in Oracle 10g Release 10.1.  It can be queried in the view v$sys_time_model,
  along with other time model statistcs.

  DB time measures the amount of time spent in the database by foreground
  processes in non-Idle state (e.g. the process is either on the CPU, or 
  actively waiting for a resource or action).  There is also a foreground
  CPU time statistic called 'DB CPU'.

  Non-idle time spent in the database is also accumulated for background 
  processes separately, in the time model statistic 'background 
  elapsed time' (there is also a 'background cpu time').

  Call Time, or Total Call Time is a proxy computed by Statspack for 
  'DB Time + bacground elapsed'.  It is based on the v$sysstat
  statistic 'CPU used by this session' + 'time spent in non-Idle waits'
  (where Idle events are in stats$idle_event).

  These numbers are usually very close, but may diverge.  Either can be used
  to perform accurate problem diagnosis.  Statspack uses both Call Time, and
  DB time, and AWR exclusively uses DB time.


6.2.  Time Units used for Performance Statistics
  Oracle now supports capturing certain performance data with millisecond and
  microsecond granularity.

  Views which include microsecond timing include:
    - v$session_wait, v$system_event, v$session_event (time_waited_micro column)
    - v$sql, v$sqlarea (cpu_time, elapsed_time columns)
    - v$latch, v$latch_parent, v$latch_children (wait_time column)
    - v$sql_workarea, v$sql_workarea_active (active_time column)

  Views which include millisecond timings include:
    - v$enqueue_stat (cum_wait_time)

  Note that existing columns in other views continue to capture centi-second 
  times.

  As centi-second and microsecond timing may not be appropriate for rolled 
  up data such as that displayed by Statspack, Statspack displays most 
  cumulative times in seconds, and average times in milliseconds (for easier 
  comparison with Operating System monitoring utilities which often report 
  timings in milliseconds).

  For clarity, the time units used are specified in the column headings of
  each timed column in the Statspack report.  The convention used is:
        (s)  - a second
        (cs) - a centisecond - which is       100th of a second
        (ms) - a millisecond - which is     1,000th of a second 
        (us) - a microsecond - which is 1,000,000th of a second 



7.  Event Timings
-----------------
If timings are available, the Statspack report will order wait events by time
(in the Top-5 and background and foreground Wait Events sections).

If timed_statistics is false for the instance, however a subset of users or
programs set timed_statistics set to true dynamically, the Statspack report
output may look inconsistent, where some events have timings (those which the
individual programs/users waited for), and the remaining events do not.
The Top-5 section will also look unusual in this situation.

Optimally, timed_statistics should be set to true at the instance level for
ease of diagnosing performance problems.



8.  Managing and Sharing performance data
-----------------------------------------

8.1. Baselining performance data

  It is possible to identify snapshot data worthy of keeping, which will not
  be purged by the Statspack purge.  This is called baselining.  Once you have
  determined which snap Ids or times of day most represent a particular 
  workload whose performance data you would like to keep, you can mark the 
  data representing those times as baselines.  Baselined snapshots will not 
  be purged by the Statspack purge.

  If you later decide you no longer want to keep previously baselined 
  snapshots, you can clear the baseline (clearing the baseline does not 
  remove the data, it just identifies the data as candidates for purging).

  NOTE:  Statspack baseline does not perform any consistency checks on the
         snapshots requested to be baselined (e.g. it does not check whether
         the specified baselines span an instance shutdown).  Instead, the
         baseline feature merely marks Snapshot rows as worthy of keeping, 
         while other data can be purged.

  New procedures and functions have been added to the Statspack package to
  make and clear baselines:  MAKE_BASELINE, and CLEAR_BASELINE.  Both of these
  are able to accept varying parameters (e.g. snap Ids, or dates, etc), and 
  can be called either as a procedure, or as a function (the function returns 
  the number of rows operated on, whereas the procedure does not).

  Snap Ids or Begin/End dates
  ---------------------------
  The Statspack MAKE_BASELINE procedures and functions provide flexibility in
  the manner baselines are made or cleared. These can take various input
  parameters:

    - Begin Snap Id and End Snap Id

      A begin and end snap Id pair can be specified.  In this case, you choose
      either to baseline the range of snapshots between the begin and end 
      snapshot pair, or just the two snapshots.  The default is to baseline
      the entire range of snapshots.

    - Begin Date and End Date

      A begin and end date pair can be specified.  All snapshots which fall in
      the date range specified will be marked as baseline data.

  Similarly to the MAKE_BASELINE procedures and functions, the CLEAR_BASELINE 
  procedures and functions accept the same arguments.  

  Procedure or Function
  ---------------------
  It is possible to call either the MAKE_BASELINE procedure, or the
  MAKE_BASELINE function.  The only difference is the MAKE_BASELINE function
  returns the number of snapshots baselined, whereas the MAKE_BASELINE
  procedure does not.
  Similarly, the CLEAR_BASELINE procedure performs the same task as the
  CLEAR_BASELINE function, however the function returns the number of
  baselined snapshots which were cleared (i.e. no longer identified as
  baselines).
  
  8.1.1. Input Parameters for the MAKE_BASELINE and CLEAR_BASELINE
         procedure and function which accept Begin and End Snap Ids

  This section describes the input parameters for the MAKE_BASELINE and 
  CLEAR_BASELINE procedure and function which accept Snap Ids.  The input 
  parameters for both MAKE and CLEAR baseline are identical.  The
  procedures/functions will either baseline (or clear the baseline for) the 
  range of snapshots between the begin and end snap Ids identified (the 
  default), or if i_snap_range parameter is FALSE, will only operate on 
  the two snapshots specified.
  If the function is called, it will return the number of snapshots 
  operated on.

                    Range of           Default
Parameter Name      Valid Values       Value    Meaning
------------------  -----------------  -------  -------------------------------
i_begin_snap        Any Valid Snap Id  -        SnapId to start the baseline at
i_end_snap          Any valid Snap Id  -        SnapId to end the baseline at
i_snap_range        TRUE/FALSE         TRUE     Should the range of snapshots
                                                between the begin and end snap
                                                be included?
i_dbid              | Any valid DBId/  Current  Caters for RAC databases
i_instance_number   | inst number      DBId/    where you may wish to baseline
                      combination      Inst #   snapshots on one instance
                      in this                   which were physically taken
                      Statspack                 on another instance
                      schema

  Example 1:
       To make a baseline of snaps 45 and 50 including the range of snapshots
       in between (and you do not wish to know the number of snapshots 
       baselined, so call the MAKE_BASELINE procedure).  Log into the PERFSTAT 
       user in SQL*Plus, and:

       SQL> exec statspack.make_baseline -
                 (i_begin_snap => 45, -
                  i_end_snap   => 50);

           Or without specifying the parameter names:

       SQL> exec statspack.make_baseline(45, 50);

  Example 2:
       To make a baseline of snaps 1237 and 1241 (including the range of 
       snapshots in between), and be informed of the number of snapshots 
       baselined (by calling the function), log into the PERFSTAT 
       user in SQL*Plus, and:

       SQL> variable num_snaps number;
       SQL> begin
       SQL>   :num_snaps := statspack.make_baseline(1237, 1241);
       SQL> end;
       SQL> /
       SQL> print num_snaps

  Example 3:
       To make a baseline of only snapshots 1237 and 1241 (excluding the
       snapshots in between), log into the PERFSTAT user in SQL*Plus, 
       and:

       SQL> exec statspack.make_baseline(5, 12, false);

  All of the prior examples apply equally to CLEAR_BASELINE.


  8.1.2. Input Parameters for the MAKE_BASELINE and CLEAR_BASELINE
         procedure and function which accept Begin and End Dates

  The input parameters for the MAKE_BASELINE and CLEAR_BASELINE procedure and
  function which accept begin and end dates are identical.  The procedures/ 
  functions will either baseline (or clear the baseline for) all snapshots
  which were taken between the begin and end dates identified.

                    Range of           Default
Parameter Name      Valid Values       Value    Meaning
------------------  -----------------  -------  -------------------------------
i_begin_date        Any valid date     -        Date to start the baseline at
i_end_date          Any valid date >   -        Date to end baseline at
                    begin date
i_dbid              | Any valid DBId/  Current  Caters for RAC databases
i_instance_number   | inst number      DBId/    where you may wish to baseline
                      combination      Inst #   snapshots on one instance
                      in this                   which were physically taken
                      Statspack                 on another instance
                      schema

  Example 1:
       To make a baseline of snapshots taken between 12-Feb-2003 at 9am, and 
       12-Feb-2003 at 12 midday (and be informed of the number of snapshots 
       affected), call the MAKE_BASELINE function.  Log into the PERFSTAT 
       user in SQL*Plus, and:

       SQL> variable num_snaps number;
       SQL> begin
       SQL>   :num_snaps := statspack.make_baseline 
                (to_date('12-FEB-2003 09:00','DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI'),
                 to_date('12-FEB-2003 12:00','DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI'));
       SQL> end;
       SQL> /
       SQL> print num_snaps

  Example 2:
       To clear an existing baseline which covers the times 13-Dec-2002 at 
       11pm and 14-Dec-2002 at 2am (without wanting to know how many 
       snapshots were affected), log into the PERFSTAT user in SQL*Plus, and:

       SQL> exec statspack.clear_baseline - 
              (to_date('13-DEC-2002 23:00','DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI'), -
               to_date('14-FEB-2002 02:00','DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI'));


8.2. Purging/removing unnecessary data

  It is possible to purge unnecessary data from the PERFSTAT schema using the
  PURGE procedures/functions.  Any Baselined snapshots will not be purged.

  NOTE:
  o It is good practice to ensure you have sufficient baselined snapshots
    before purging data.
  o It is recommended you export the schema as a backup before running this
    script, either using your own export parameters, or those provided in
    spuexp.par
  o WARNING:  It is no longer possible to rollback a requested purge operation.
  o The functionality which was in the sppurge.sql SQL script has been moved 
    into the STATSPACK package.  Moving the purge functionality into the 
    STATSPACK package has allowed significantly more flexibility in how 
    the data to be purged can be specified by the performance engineer.


  Purge Criteria for the STATSPACK PURGE procedures and functions
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Data to be purged can either be specified by:

    - Begin Snap Id and End Snap Id

      A begin and end snap Id pair can be specified.  In this case, you choose
      either to purge the range of snapshots between the begin and end 
      snapshot pair (inclusive, which is the default), or just the two 
      snapshots specified.
      The preexisting Statspack sppurge.sql SQL script has been modified to 
      use this PURGE procedure (which purges by begin/end snap Id range).

    - Begin Date and End Date

      A begin and end date pair can be specified.  All snapshots which were
      taken between the begin and end date will be purged.

    - Purge before date

      All snapshots which were taken before the specified date will be purged.

    - Number of days (N)

      All snapshots which were taken N or more days prior to the current date
      and time (i.e. SYSDATE) will be purged.

  Extended Purge
  --------------
  In prior releases, Statspack identifier tables which contained SQL Text, 
  SQL Execution plans, and Segment identifiers were not purged.

  It is now possible to purge the unreferenced data in these tables.  This is
  done by requesting the 'extended purge' be performed at the same time as 
  the normal purge.  Requesting the extended purge be performed along with a
  normal purge is simply a matter of setting the input parameter 
  i_extended_purge to TRUE when calling the regular purge.

  Purging this data may be resource intensive, so you may choose to perform
  an extended purge less frequently than the normal purge.

  Procedure or Function
  ---------------------
  Each of the purge procedures has a corresponding function.  The function
  performs the same task as the procedure, but returns the number of 
  Snapshot rows purged (whereas the procedure does not).


  8.2.1. Input Parameters for the PURGE procedure and function
         which accept Begin Snap Id and End Snap Id

  This section describes the input parameters for the PURGE procedure and 
  function which accept Snap Ids.  The input parameters for both procedure
  and function are identical.  The procedure/function will purge all 
  snapshots between the begin and end snap Ids identified (inclusive, which 
  is the default), or if i_snap_range parameter is FALSE, will only purge 
  the two snapshots specified. If i_extended_purge is TRUE, an extended purge 
  is also performed.
  If the function is called, it will return the number of snapshots purged.

                    Range of           Default
Parameter Name      Valid Values       Value    Meaning
------------------  -----------------  -------  -------------------------------
i_begin_snap        Any Valid Snap Id  -        SnapId to start purging from
i_end_snap          Any valid Snap Id  -        SnapId to end purging at
i_snap_range        TRUE/FALSE         TRUE     Should the range of snapshots
                                                between the begin and end snap
                                                be included?
i_extended_purge    TRUE/FALSE         FALSE    Determines whether unused
                                                SQL Text, SQL Plans and 
                                                Segment Identifiers will be
                                                purged in addition to the
                                                normal data purged
i_dbid              | Any valid DBId/  Current  Caters for RAC databases
i_instance_number   | inst number      DBId/    where you may wish to baseline
                      combination      Inst #   snapshots on one instance
                      in this                   which were physically taken
                      Statspack                 on another instance
                      schema

  Example 1:
       Purge all snapshots between the specified begin and end snap ids.  Also
       purge unused SQL Text, SQL Plans and Segment Identifiers, and
       return the number of snapshots purged.  Log into the PERFSTAT user 
       in SQL*Plus, and:

       SQL> variable num_snaps number;
       SQL> begin
       SQL>   :num_snaps := statspack.purge
                 ( i_begin_snap=>1237, i_end_snap=>1241
                 , i_extended_purge=>TRUE);
       SQL> end;
       SQL> /
       SQL> print num_snaps       


  8.2.2.  Input Parameters for the PURGE procedures and functions
          which accept Begin Date and End Date

  This section describes the input parameters for the PURGE procedure and 
  function which accept a begin date and an end date.  The procedure/
  function will purge all snapshots taken between the specified begin and 
  end dates.  The input parameters for both procedure and function are 
  identical.  If i_extended_purge is TRUE, an extended purge is also performed.
  If the function is called, it will return the number of snapshots purged.

                    Range of           Default
Parameter Name      Valid Values       Value    Meaning
------------------  -----------------  -------  -------------------------------

                    date               -        SnapId to end the baseline at
i_extended_purge    TRUE/FALSE         FALSE    Determines whether unused
                                                SQL Text, SQL Plans and 
                                                Segment Identifiers will be
                                                purged in addition to the
                                                normal data purged
i_dbid              | Any valid DBId/  Current  Caters for RAC databases

                      Statspack                 on another instance
                      schema

  Example 1:
       Purge all snapshots which fall between 01-Jan-2003 and 02-Jan-2003.
       Also perform an extended purge.  Log into the PERFSTAT user in 
       SQL*Plus, and:

        SQL> exec statspack.purge -
               (i_begin_date=>to_date('01-JAN-2003', 'DD-MON-YYYY'), -
                i_end_date  =>to_date('02-JAN-2003', 'DD-MON-YYYY'), -
                i_extended_purge=>TRUE);


  8.2.3. Input Parameters for the PURGE procedure and function
         which accept a single Purge Before Date

  This section describes the input parameters for the PURGE procedure and 
  function which accept a single date.  The procedure/function will purge
  all snapshots older than the date specified.  If i_extended_purge is TRUE,
  also perform an extended purge.  The input parameters for both 
  procedure and function are identical.
  If the function is called, it will return the number of snapshots purged.

                    Range of           Default

                      schema

  Example 1:
       To purge data older than a specified date, without wanting to know the 
       number of snapshots purged, log into the PERFSTAT user in SQL*Plus,
       and:

       SQL> exec statspack.purge(to_date('31-OCT-2002','DD-MON-YYYY'));


  8.2.4. Input Parameters for the PURGE procedure and function
         which accept the Number of Days of data to keep

  This section describes the input parameters for the PURGE procedure and 
  function which accept the number of days of snapshots to keep.  All data
  older than the specified number of days will be purged.  The input 
  parameters for both procedure and function are identical.  If 
  i_extended_purge is TRUE, also perform an extended purge.
  If the function is called, it will return the number of snapshots purged.

                    Range of           Default
Parameter Name      Valid Values       Value    Meaning
------------------  -----------------  -------  -------------------------------

                      schema

  Example 1:
       To purge data older than 31 days, without wanting to know the number 
       of snapshots operated on, log into the PERFSTAT user in SQL*Plus, and:

       SQL> exec statspack.purge(31);


8.2.5. Using sppurge.sql

  When sppurge is run, the instance currently connected to, and the
  available snapshots are displayed.  The DBA is then prompted for the
  low Snap Id and high Snap Id.  All snapshots which fall within this 
  range will be purged.

  WARNING:  sppurge.sql has been modified to use the new Purge functionality
            in the STATSPACK package, therefore it is no longer possible to 
            rollback a requested purge operation - the purge is automatically
            committed.

  e.g. Purging data - connect to PERFSTAT using SQL*Plus, then run the
       sppurge.sql script - sample example output appears below.

SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
SQL>  set transaction use rollback segment rbig;
SQL>  @sppurge

WARNING
~~~~~~~
sppurge.sql deletes all snapshots ranging between the lower and
upper bound Snapshot Id's specified, for the database instance
you are connected to.  Snapshots identified as Baseline snapshots
which lie within the snapshot range will not be purged.

It is NOT possible to rollback changes once the purge begins.

You may wish to export this data before continuing.

Specify the Lo Snap Id and Hi Snap Id range to purge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using 1 for lower bound.

Enter value for hisnapid: 2
Using 2 for upper bound.

Deleting snapshots 1 - 2

SQL> -- end of example output


      Batch mode purging
      ------------------
      To purge in batch mode, you must assign values to the SQL*Plus
      variables which specify the low and high snapshot Ids to purge.

      The variables are:
        losnapid   -> Begin Snapshot Id
        hisnapid   -> End Snapshot Id

      e.g.
          SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
          SQL>  define losnapid=1
          SQL>  define hisnapid=2
          SQL>  @sppurge

      sppurge will no longer prompt for the above information.


8.3. Removing all data

  If you wish to truncate all performance data indiscriminately, it is
  possible to do this using sptrunc.sql  This script truncates all
  statistics data gathered, including snapshots marked as baselines.

  NOTE:
  It is recommended you export the schema as a backup before running this
  script either using your own export parameters, or those provided in
  spuexp.par

  If you run sptrunc.sql in error, the script allows you to exit before
  beginning the truncate operation (you do this at the 'begin_or_exit' 
  prompt by typing in 'exit').

  To truncate all data, connect to the PERFSTAT user using SQL*Plus, 
  and run the script - sample output which truncates data is below:

    SQL>  connect perfstat/perfstat_password
    SQL>  @sptrunc

    Warning
    ~~~~~~~
    Running sptrunc.sql removes ALL data from Statspack tables.  You may
    wish to export the data before continuing.


    About to Truncate Statspack Tables
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    If would like to exit WITHOUT truncating the tables, enter any text at the
    begin_or_exit prompt (e.g. 'exit'), otherwise if you would like to begin
    the truncate operation, press <return>


    Enter value for begin_or_exit: 
    Entered at the 'begin_or_exit' prompt

    ... Starting truncate operation

    Table truncated.
    Table truncated.
    <etc...>

    Commit complete.

    Package altered.

    ... Truncate operation complete


8.4. Sharing data via export

  If you wish to share data with other sites (for example if Oracle
  Support requires the raw statistics), it is possible to export 
  the PERFSTAT user.

  An export parameter file (spuexp.par) has been supplied for this
  purpose.  To use this file, supply the export command with the 
  userid parameter, along with the export parameter file name.
  e.g.
    exp userid=perfstat/perfstat_password parfile=spuexp.par

  This will create a file called spuexp.dmp and the log file spuexp.log

  If you wish to load the data into another database, use the import
  command.  For more information on using export and import, please 
  see the Oracle Utilities manual.



9.  New and Changed Features
----------------------------

9.1.  Changes between 10.2  and 11.1

Changes on the Summary Page of the Instance Report 
  o  Host
     - Platform name has been added to the Host information.
     - The number of CPU cores and sockets is displayed, where available.
     - Physical Memory is now shown in GB rather than MB.
  o  Snapshot information
     - The DB time and DB CPU in seconds, is now printed close to the 
       snapshot Elapsed time.
  o  Load Profile
     - DB time and DB CPU have been added to Load Profile.  Units are
       Per Second, Per Transaction, Per Execute and Per Call
       The addtion of this normalized data assists when examinig
       to reports to see whether the load is comparable.
     - The number of 'Sorts' has been replaced with 'W/A MB processed'.  
       Displaying workarea statistics more accurately reflects not
       only sorts, but also other workarea operations such as hash
       joins.  Additionally, using MB processed rather than the number
       of workarea operations indicates the quantity of workarea work
       performed.
     - The following statistics have been removed from the front page,
       as they are no longer considered as important as they once were:
         % Blocks changed per Read
         Recursive Call %
         Rollback per transaction %
         Rows per Sort

  o Instance Efficiency
    - This section has been renamed from 'Instance Efficiency Percentages'
      to 'Instance Efficiency Indicators', as this more accurately
      represents that these values are simply indicators of possible
      areas to consider, rather than conclusive evidence.
   - 'In-memory Sort %' has been replaced with 'Optimal W/A Exec %'
     as the old statistic only showed sorts, and not all workarea
     operations.


Modified sections of the Instance Report
  o  Wait Events and Background Wait Event
     The % of Total Call Time has been added to these sections.  Rows which
     have null for the % of Call Time are Idle Events, and so do not
     contribute to the % Total Call time.

  o  The PGA Memory Advisory now shows the Estimated Time to process the
     data.

  o  The init.ora parameters section now shows the entire parameter value
     rather than truncating the output

  o  SQL sections
     SQL statements which have not completed execution (e.g. have a 0
     execution count as the statement was still running when the End
     snapshot was taken) can now appear in the SQL reports.


New Data captured/reported on - Level 1
  o  Foreground Wait Events
     A new wait event section has been added.  This shows wait events
     for foreground processes only.

  o  OS Statistics - detail (from v$osstat)
     This is a new section which shows the Load, %Busy, %User, %System
     %WIO and %WCPU for each snapshot between the Begin and End snapshot
     Ids specified.

  o  IO Stat by Function - summary (from v$iostat_function)
     This section shows IO statistics broken down by Oracle function.
     A by-function breakdown can help identify where the IO bandwith 
     is being consumed (e.g. by RMAN, DBWR, recovery, direct IO).
     The summary section summarizes IO requests and IO rates.

  o  IO Stat by Function - detail (from v$iostat_function)
     Similar to above, however this section shows details how the
     IO requests and IO rates break down by small requests and
     large requests (requests > 128k).

  o  Memory Target Advice (from v$memory_target_advice)
     Shows potential values for memory_target parameter, and
     their estimated cost, in DB time.

  o  Memory Dynamic Components
     Shows infomration about the last resize operation for each
     Memory Component.

  o  Memory Resize Operations
     Shows all known Memory resize operations which occured between
     the Begin and End snapshots.


Obsoleted data
  o  v$temp_histogram view and the corresponding Statspack table have
     been dropped.



9.2.  Changes between 10.1  and 10.2

Changes on the Summary Page of the Instance Report 
  o  The front summary page of the instance report has been modified to show
      - Host CPU and Memory configuration
      - begin/end buffer cache and shared pool sizes (end values are only 
        shown if they differ from the begin values)
      - Ave Wait (ms) for the Top-5 Timed Events section


Continuation of Summary Page on Page 2
  o  Page 2 of the Statspack report should be considered a continuation of
     the front-page summary of the Statspack report.  This page includes:
        - Memory and CPU statistics captured by Oracle in the v$osstat view
        - ratios derived from v$osstat and the Time model data 
          (v$sys_time_model)
        - the raw Time-model system statistics data

     These statistics should be consulted in conjunction with page 1 data 
     during the initial performance analysis stage, when formulating the
     list of potential drill-down data to examine:
     o  The Operating System statistics data should be used to identify
        whether the host is CPU bound, and if so, how much this Oracle 
        instance is  contributing to the CPU usage.
     o  The Memory usage statistics show how much of physical memory is 
        consumed, and how much physical memory is used by the SGA and 
        PGA for this instance.
     Please note that not all of the OS statistics are available on all
     platforms.


Sections moved in the Instance Report
  o  The Time Model System Stats section has moved to page 2 of the report
     (see Continuation of Summary Page on Page 2, above).

  o  The OS Stats section has been moved to follow the System Statistics
     sections.


Modified sections of the Instance Report
  o  The Wait Events and Background Wait Events section of the report have
     been modified to only show events with a total wait time of > .001s
     to filter out unimportant events.

  o  The Timeouts column in the System Event and Background Event sections have
     changed to be %Timeouts (as compared to Waits).  Note that to avoid
     loss of data, a %Timeouts value of 0 indicates timeouts occurred in < .5%.
     A value of null indicates 0 timeouts.

  o  The SGA regions section of the report now shows the Begin and End sizes
     of the various regions (the end sizes are only shown if different to
     the begin sizes).

  o  The File IO Histogram section has been modified to include a new
     bucket (<=2ms).

  o  The Buffer Pool Statistics section now shows the number of buffers in
     K, M or G (where K is 1000 buffers, M is 1000000 buffers and G
     is 1000000000 buffers)

  o  Omitting sections from the Statspack report
     -  The Rollstat sections of the report are omitted from the output when
        Automatic Undo Management is used.  If you still wish to see these 
        sections when using AUM, modify the display_rollstat parameter in 
        the sprepcon.sql file.
     -  It is also possible to avoid including the following sections in the
        Instance report.  However modifying these default settings is not
        recommended, as valuable data may be missing during performance
        diagnosis.
           o  Undostat (Automatic Undo data)
           o  File IO details

  o  Undo Segment Summary section now also shows the Min and Max values for
     Tuned Undo Retention.


Changes in Data captured/reported on - Level 1
  o  The v$sgastat view has been modified in 10gR2 to show separate
     rows for all memory allocations, without the summary 'Miscellaneous'
     row.  This now results over 500 individual rows.
     To avoid capturing excessive and unneeded data, Statspack has been
     optimized to capture only that data which will be useful when 
     investigating memory usage.  It is expected Statspack will capture 
     in the order of 50 rows per snapshot.
     To avoid showing all of these rows in the report, only the top rows
     are shown (by default 35 rows are shown, although this can be
     increased if needed by modifying the sgastat_top_n in sprepcon.sql).


New sections of the Instance Report
  o  Some SGA resizes can be detected by Statspack, when the individual
     cache sizes are different at the time the snapshot is taken.
     Any changes in cache sizes visible at snapshot time are shown
     in the Cache Size Changes section of the report.

  o  Two new SQL sections have been added - SQL ordered by CPU and
     SQL ordered by Elapsed time.  These are now the first two
     SQL sections (i.e. they appear before 'SQL ordered by Gets')
     New thresholds for CPU and Elapsed time were not added to the data
     capture,  as it is believed that the top SQL in these categories 
     is already being captured by the existing thresholds.

  o  Two new process (PGA) memory sections have been added to the
     Statspack Instance report:
      o  Process Memory Summary Stats, which shows a summary
         of process memory allocation and usage for both begin and
         end snapshots
      o  Top Process Memory (by component), which shows process
         information for the process which have the most memory
         allocated, broken down by component (for the begin and
         end snapshots).

  o  The SQL Memory Statistics section has been added.  This section
     displays a summary of memory usage statistics for cursors.


New Data captured/reported on - Level 1
  SGA Target Advisory (from v$sga_target)
  Streams Pool Advisory (from v$streams_pool_advice)
  PGA Memory usage (from v$process, and v$process_memory)
     (see New sections of the instance report above for more
      information)
     

Real Application Cluster Features
  o  The 'RAC Statistics' page now computes the estimated interconnect
     traffic in KB/sec (Estd Interconnect traffic (KB/s)) in the Global
     Cache Load Profile section.
     Note your database's standard block size is used to compute this
     statistic, so if your database uses multiple block sizes, this 
     statistic may have an estimation error.  This statistic also does 
     not account for PQ messages.

  o  v$class_cache_transfer is no longer captured (and the corresponding
     Statspack table has been dropped).  Instead Statspack now captures
     v$instance_cache_transfer.
  o  Dynamic Remastering Statistics section had been added.


SQL Report (sprepsql.sql)
  o  The time a plan was last active is shown in the SQL report for each
     known plan.


Obsoleted data
  o  The sleeps 1-3 columns have been obsoleted in this release,
     therefore Statspack no longer captures, nor reports on this
     data (for v$latch_parent, v$latch_children, v$latch)



9.3.  Changes between 9.2 and 10.1

Baseline
  It is now possible to identify snapshots which you wish to keep.  These
  snapshots are termed baselined snapshots.  Baselined snapshots will not
  be purged by the Statspack purge.  For more information, see section
  'Baselining performance data'


Purge
  The purge code has been moved from sppurge.sql into the STATSPACK
  package, and has been significantly enhanced.  Having the purge 
  functionality in the Statspack package allows greater flexibility in 
  specifying which data to purge (e.g. by date range, or by purging 
  snapshots older than N days, etc).  For more information, see section 
  'Purging/removing unnecessary data'.


Streams
  Performance data for Streams is now captured.  See section 'New Data
  captured/reported - Level 1', below for more details.


V$SQL.HASH_VALUE and V$SQL.OLD_HASH_VALUE columns
  The algorithm used to calculate the hash_value column in the V$SQL view
  (and V$SQL* related views) has been modified in 10g.  In other words, the 
  hash_value for a statement in Oracle 10g will not be the same as the
  hash_value for that same statement in prior releases.

  To allow for backward compatibility, and comparison of the performance of
  SQL statements in releases prior to 10g, Statspack continues to use the
  old hash value as one of the columns comprising the primary key for the
  Statspack SQL related tables.  The old-format hash value is visible
  in the v$sql.old_hash_value column (this has been added to the V$SQL and
  related views for backward compatibility).

  In the Statspack reports, Statspack continues to display the old hash
  value for backward compatibility (this column is clearly identified as 
  Old Hash Value).

  For more information on the hash_value change, see 'Data Compatibility - 
  Changing SQL Hash Value, and new SQL Id' below.


Running the Report

  o  Number of Days of Snapshots to List
  It is now possible to influence certain aspects of what appears in the
  Instance report, including the number of days of snapshots to list when
  choosing the begin and end snapshots.
  The configuration is performed by modifying the 'Customer Configurable
  Report Settings' section of the file sprepcon.sql.
  For more information see 'Configuring the Report' section of this document.

  o  Error Reporting
  Error reporting has been modified, so that an input error made when
  running the report now results in the report terminating with the
  error shown, and the session being disconnected from SQL*Plus.  
  The error messages have also been modified to show the actual values 
  which caused the errors - this makes it easier to identify why the 
  report has been terminated, and so how the error can be avoided.
  e.g.  When running spreport, if you accidentally enter a snapshot id which
        does not exist, an error is reported, and the report exits.
    declare
    *
    ERROR at line 1:
    ORA-20200: Begin Snapshot Id 3469 does not exist for this database/instance
    ORA-06512: at line 25


SQL sections of the Instance Report
  o  The SQL ordered by Gets, Reads and Parse Calls sections have all been
     modified to:

    - only show rows which exceed more than 1% of the total resources
      used for entire interval.  This reduces the number of rows which are
      candidates for printing.  This is identified in the title of the section.

      e.g. For SQL ordered by Parse Calls, only those rows which exceed
           1% of the total parse calls will be candidates for displaying
           in this section.)

           -> SQL reported below exceeded 1% of total Parse Calls

      This line in the title of the Parse Calls section identifies that 
      only SQL statements which exceeded 1% of the total parse calls 
      incurred in the interval (specified by the begin and end snapshots) 
      will be included.  

      Note that not all of the SQL that exceeded the 1% threshold are printed 
      in the report, just the highest-load.

    - The total number of resources used by captured statements is compared
      to the total number of resources used over the entire interval (as
      specified by the begin and end snapshots).  This comparison helps 
      identify how much of the total load can be accounted for in the 
      high-load SQL captured.
      e.g. In the title for the SQL ordered by Gets section of the report, 
           a line similar to the following will appear

           -> Captured SQL accounts for   74.8% of total Buffer Gets

      This identifies that 74.8% of the total Buffer gets incurred during 
      the interval is attributable to the high-load SQL captured by Statspack
      (Note that not all captured statements are displayed in the report, only
      those which are the highest load).

  o  New SQL report 'SQL ordered by Cluster Wait Time'
  There is a new SQL report added to the SQL reports section.  This report
  lists the top-SQL ordered by Cluster Wait Time.  This report may be useful
  in Real Application Cluster databases.


Derived Statistics
  There is one new statistic in the Instance Activity Sections which
  does not come from V$SYSSTAT: 'log switches (derived)'.
  This statistic is derived from the v$thread view which Statspack now 
  captures.  This statistic is shown in a new Instance Activity Stats sections
  of the instance report, as described below.


Two new Instance Activity Stats sections
  There are two new Instance Activity Stats sections in the instance report.

  The first shows the begin and end absolute values of statistics which 
  should not be diffed (typically performing a diff is incorrect, because 
  the statistics show current values, rather than cumulative values).
  These statistics come from v$sysstat (as do the other Instance Activity
  statistics).
  
   Instance Activity Stats  DB/Inst: MAINDB/maindb  Snaps: 22-23
   -> Statistics with absolute values (should not be diffed)
   -> Statistics identified by '(derived)' come from sources other than SYSSTAT

   Statistic                             Begin Value       End Value
   --------------------------------- --------------- ---------------
   logons current                                 10              10
   opened cursors current                         41              49
   session cursor cache count                     24              36

  The second shows the number of log switches, which is derived from the 
  v$thread view.

   Instance Activity Stats  DB/Inst: MAINDB/maindb  Snaps: 22-23

   Statistic                                      Total  per Hour
   --------------------------------- ------------------ ---------
   log switches (derived)                             0       .00


New Scripts
  o  sprsqins.sql - Reports on a single SQL statement (i.e. hash_value), 
                    including the SQL statistics for the snapshot, the
                    complete SQL text and optimizer execution plan information.
                    This report differs from sprepsql.sql, in that it
                    can report on a SQL statement for any instance which 
                    the PERFSTAT schema contains, whereas sprepsql.sql defaults
                    the dbid and instance number to the instance you are
                    currently connected to, thus restricting reporting of
                    SQL statements to those related to that instance only.
                    sprsqins.sql will prompt for a dbid, instance_number,
                    begin and end snap id's and the hash value of the SQL
                    statement to report on.
                    This report can be used when importing data from another
                    instance, or in a Real Application Clusters environment
                    to report on an instance which you are not directly 
                    connected to.
 o  sprepcon.sql  - This file contains SQL*Plus parameters which determine
                    some aspects of what is printed out in the Statspack
                    Instance report spreport.sql  For more details on what
                    is configurable, see the sprepcon.sql file itself.

Cluster Features
  o  Real Application Clusters Statistics page (page 2 of a clustered 
     database report) has been modified to add new ratios and remove ratios 
     considered less useful. 

  o  The Global Enqueue Statistics section, previously on page 3 of a RAC 
     instance report, has been moved to behind the Library Cache Activity 
     statistics.

  o  Statistics for CR and CURRENT blocks served, and for INSTANCE CACHE 
     TRANSFER, have been added after Global Enqueue Statistics page.

  o  New SQL report 'SQL ordered by Cluster Wait Time' has been added.


9.4.  Changes between 9.0 and 9.2

Changes on the Summary Page of the Instance Report (spreport.sql)

  o  The Top 5 Wait Events has been changed to be the Top 5 Timed Events.

     What was previously the Top 5 Wait Events has been expanded to give the
     Top 5 timed events within the instance: i.e. in addition to including 
     Wait events, this section can now include the CPU time as reported in the
     'CPU used by this session' statistic.  This statistic will appear in the 
     Top 5 only if it's value is one of the Top 5 users of time for the 
     snapshot interval.

         Note that the name of the statistic 'CPU used by this session' will
         actually appear in the Top 5 section as 'CPU Time'.  The statistic
         name is masked in the Top 5 to avoid the confusion of the suffix
         'by this session'.
         The statistic will continue to appear in the System Statistics
         (SYSSTAT) section of the report as 'CPU used by this session'.

     Additionally, instead of the percentage calculation being the % Total 
     Wait Time (which is time for each wait event divided by the total wait
     time), the percentage calculation is now the % Total Call Time.

     Call Time is the total time spent in database calls (i.e. the total 
     non-idle time spent within the database either on the CPU, or actively 
     waiting).

     We compute 'Call Time' by adding the time spent on the CPU ('CPU used by 
     this session' statistic) to the time used by all non-idle wait events.
     i.e. 
         total call time = total CPU time + total wait time for non-idle events

     The % Total Call Time shown in the 'Top 5' heading on the summary page 
     of the report, is the time for each timed event divided by the total call 
     time (i.e. non-idle time).
     i.e.
       previously the calculation was:
         time for each wait event  / total wait time for all events
       now the calculation is:
         time for each timed event / total call time


     Purpose
     ~~~~~~~
     The purpose for including CPU time with wait events:

     When tuning a system, the first step is to identify where the most of the 
     time is spent, in order to identify where the most productive tuning 
     effort should be concentrated.

     The majority of time could be spent in waiting for events to complete
     (and so be identifiable in the wait event data), or the system could be 
     consuming much CPU (for which Operating System statistics, and the Oracle
     CPU statistic 'CPU used by this session' in SYSSTAT are examined).
     Having the CPU Time co-located with the wait events in the Top 5 section 
     of the instance report makes it easier to compare the relative values
     and to identify whether the most productive investigation would occur 
     by drilling down the wait events, or in reducing Oracle CPU usage 
     (e.g. by tuning SQL).

Changes on the Top SQL sections of the Report (spreport.sql)

  o  When specified by the application, the MODULE information is reported
     just before the SQL statement itself.
     This information is preceded by the mention "Module: "

New columns added to
  - stats$db_cache_advice
    size_factor: compares the estimated cache size with the current cache size
  - stats$sql_plan
    search_columns: the number of index columns with matching predicates.
    access_predicates: predicates used to locate rows in an access structure.
        For example, start and/or stop predicates for an index range scan.
    filter_predicates: predicates used to filter rows before producing them.
  - stats$sql_summary
    child_latch: the library cache child latch number which protects this
        SQL statement (join to v$latch_children.child#). A parent SQL
        statement, and all it's children are protected by the same library
        cache child latch.
    fetches: the number of fetches performed for this SQL statement

New Scripts
  o  spup90.sql  - Upgrades a 9.0 Statspack schema to the 9.2 format

New Data captured/reported on - Level 1
  - Shared Pool Advisory
  - PGA statistics including PGA Advisory, PGA Histogram usage

New Data captured/reported on - Level 7
  - Segment level Statistics

Cluster Features
  o  Real Application Clusters Statistics page (page 2 of a clustered database
     report) has been significantly modified to add new ratios and remove 
     ratios deemed less useful.
  o  RAC specific segment level statistics are captured with level 7

SQL Plan Usage capture changed
  o  The logic for capturing SQL Plan Usage data (level 6) has been modified
     significantly.  Instead of capturing a Plan's Usage once the first time
     the plan is used and never again thereafter, the algorithm now captures
     the plans used each snapshot.  This allows tracking whether multiple
     plans are in use concurrently, or whether a plan has reverted back to
     an older plan.
     Note that plan usage data is only captured for high-load SQL (this is
     unchanged between 9.0 and 9.2).

     Due to the significant change in data capture, it is not possible to
     convert existing data.  Instead, any pre-existing data will be
     archived into the table STATS$SQL_PLAN_USAGE_90 (this allows querying
     the archived data, should this be necessary).


sprepsql.sql
  o  'All Optimizer Plan(s) for this Hash Value' change:
     Instead of showing the first time a plan was seen for a specific hash
     value, this section now shows each time the Optimizer Plan
     changed since the SQL statement was first seen e.g. if the SQL statement
     had the following plan changes:
       snap ids      plan hash value
       --------      ---------------
         1 ->  12    AAAAAAA
        13 -> 134    BBBBBBB
       145 -> 299    CCCCCCC
       300 -> 410    AAAAAAA

    Then this section of the report will now show:
       snap id       plan hash value
       --------      ---------------
              1      AAAAAAA
             13      BBBBBBB
            145      CCCCCCC
            300      AAAAAAA

     Previously, only the rows with snap_id's 1, 13 and 145 would have been 
     displayed, as these were the first snap Id's these plans were found.
     However this data could not show that plan AAAAAA was found again in 
     snap_id 300.

     The new output format makes it easier to see when an older plan is again
     in use.  This is possible due to the change in the SQL Plan Usage 
     capture (described above).


9.5.  Changes between 8.1.7 and 9.0

Timing data
  o columns with cumulative times are now displayed in seconds.

Changes on the Summary Page
  o  All cache sizes are now reported in M or K

New Statistics on the Summary page
  o  open cursors per session values for the begin and end snapshot
  o  comments specified when taking a snapshot are displayed for the
     begin and end snapshots

Latches
  o The Latch Activity, Child and Parent Latch sections have the following
   additional column:
   -  wait_time: cumulative time spent waiting for the latch

New Scripts
  o  spup817.sql  - Upgrades an 8.1.7 Statspack schema to the 9.0 format
  o  sprepsql.sql - Reports on a single hash_value, including
                    the SQL statistics for the snapshot, the complete SQL
                    text and optimizer execution plan information.
  o  sprepins.sql - A report which can be run to query performance data
                    for any instance which the PERFSTAT schema contains.
                    The report will prompt for a dbid, instance_number and
                    begin and end snap id's.
                    This report can be used when importing data from another
                    instance, or in a Real Application Clusters environment
                    to report on an instance which you are not directly 
                    connected to.

New Data captured/reported on - Level 1
  - Data from v$resource_limit
  - If the instance is a Cluster instance, v$dlm_misc data
  - Additional columns are now captured in stats$enqueue_stat
  - Automatic Undo Management statistics
  - Buffer Cache advisory data
  - New Auto-PGA memory management data
  - Support for multiple sized-block buffer pools
  - Support for resizable buffer pool and shared pool
  - Data from v$instance_recovery

New Snapshot Level - Level 6
  - New SQL plans and SQL Plan usage information for high-load SQL 
    statements are captured.

Cluster Features
 o  There is additional derived data and statistics which are now included
    in the Statspack report for a clustered database.  For more information,
    see the 'Cluster Specific Data' section of this document.

New SNAP function
  o the call to take a snapshot can also be a PL/SQL function call which
    returns the snapshot Id of the snapshot taken.  Using the function rather
    than the procedure is useful in situations where you wish to know the
    snap_id immediately, such as when running Statspack reports in batch
    mode, or during benchmark runs.

Installation
  o  The installation script will no longer accept the SYSTEM tablespace for
     the PERFSTAT user's DEFAULT or TEMPORARY tablespace.  If SYSTEM is
     specified, the installation will error.

SQL
  o  Each SQL report has two new columns CPU Time and Elapsed Time.  These
     show the cumulative CPU time and Elapsed time for all executions of
     that SQL statement for the snapshot period.  If cumulative CPU and
     Elapsed times are not shown, the CPU and Elapsed times per execute
     are shown.

Changed
  o  The SGA Breakdown difference section of the Statspack report now 
     shows the difference between begin and end values as a percentage
     of the begin value, rather than in bytes.
  o  The data in the Dictionary Cache Stats and Library Cache Activity
     sections are only printed if the number of gets is greater than zero.


9.6.  Changes between 8.1.6 and 8.1.7

New Statistics on the Summary page
  o  connections at the begin snapshot and connections at the end snapshot

  Load Profile
  o  executes per transaction and per second
  o  logons per transaction and per second

  Instance Efficiency
  o  % Non-Parse CPU: which is the parse time CPU / CPU used by this session
  o  Parse CPU to Parse Elapsd%: which is the parse time CPU / parse time 
     elapsed
  o  Execute to Parse %:  The ratio of executions to parses

  Instance Efficiency - Shared Pool Statistics are shown for the begin and 
  end snapshots.
  o  Memory Usage %:  The percentage of the shared pool which is used.
  o  % SQL with executions>1:  The percentage of reused SQL (i.e. the
     percentage of SQL statements with more than one execution).
  o  % Memory for SQL w/exec>1:  The percentage of memory used for SQL
     statements with more than one execution.
  This data is newly gathered by the 8.1.7 Statspack for level 5 snapshots
  and above, and so will not evident if the report is run against older 
  data captured using the 8.1.6 Statspack.

Tablespace and File IO
  o  Tempfile statistics are now captured.  The statistics for tempfiles are
     shown in the same sections with statistics for datafiles and tablespaces.
  o  The tablespace and File IO reports have been modified to include reads/s
     and writes/s.

Latches
  o  The report has been modified to include parent and child latch 
     sections, which only appears in the report when a level 10 snapshot 
     is taken.

New Scripts
  o  sppurge.sql - Purges a range of Snapshot Ids
  o  sptrunc.sql - Deletes all data
  o  spup816.sql - Upgrades an 8.1.6 Statspack to the 8.1.7 schema

Batch Mode execution
  o  The installation, reporting and purge scripts (spcreate.sql, spreport.sql
     and sppurge.sql) have been modified so they can be run in batch mode, if 
     the appropriate SQL*Plus variables are defined before the scripts are run.

SQL
  o  Two new SQL thresholds (and sections in the report) have been added:  
     sharable_mem and version_count
  o  The report which was previously ordered by rows processed has been
     changed to be ordered by executions
  o  The full text of a SQL statement is now captured (previously only the
     first 1000 bytes of the text was captured); the text is captured once
     only.  Previously, Statspack gathered all SQL related information, 
     including all the SQL text for each snapshot.  The new strategy will
     result less space usage.
  o  The first 5 lines of a SQL statement are shown in each SQL report
     (rather than the first line)

File Rename
  o  The Statspack files have been renamed, with all files now beginning 
     with the prefix sp.
     The new and old file names are given below.  For more information on
     the purpose of each file, please see the Supplied Scripts Overview 
     section.

     New Name       Old Name
     ------------   -------------
     spdoc.txt      statspack.doc
     spcreate.sql   statscre.sql
     spreport.sql   statsrep.sql
     spauto.sql     statsauto.sql
     spuexp.par     statsuexp.par
     sppurge.sql    - new file -
     sptrunc.sql    - new file -
     spup816.sql    - new file -
     spdrop.sql     statsdrp.sql
     spcpkg.sql     statspack.sql
     spctab.sql     statsctab.sql
     spcusr.sql     statscusr.sql
     spdtab.sql     statsdtab.sql
     spdusr.sql     statsdusr.sql

  o  The default Statspack report output file name prefix has been modified 
     to sp_ (was st_) to be consistent with the new script names.



10.  Compatibility and Upgrading from previous releases
-------------------------------------------------------

10.1  Compatibility Matrix

    Database       ---- Statspack Release ----
    Release     11.1  10.2  10.1    9.2    9.0  8.1.7  8.1.6
    --------    ----  ----  ----    ---   ----  -----  -----

    8.1.6          -     -     -      -      -      -      Y

In summary, it is best to use the Statspack release shipped with
the version of the database you are using.

If you are already using an earlier release of Statspack must use
a newer Statspack release (e.g. because you are upgrading the database),
it is possible to upgrade an existing Statspack schema, and so
keep previously captured data.  See the 'Upgrading an existing Statspack 
schema to a newer release' section of this document.


10.1.1. Using Statspack shipped with 11.1

The Statspack scripts shipped with 11.1 can not be used with any release
earlier than 11.1, as Statspack uses new v$views (and new columns added to 
existing v$views) introduced in this server release.


10.1.2. Using Statspack shipped with 10.2

The Statspack scripts shipped with 10.2 can not be used with any release
earlier than 10.2, as Statspack uses new v$views (and new columns added to 
existing v$views) introduced in this server release.


10.1.3. Using Statspack shipped with 10.1

The Statspack scripts shipped with 10.1 can not be used with any release
earlier than 10.1, as Statspack uses new v$views (and new columns added to 
existing v$views) introduced in this server release.


10.1.4. Using Statspack shipped with 9.2

The Statspack scripts shipped with 9.2 can not be used with any release
earlier than 9.2, as Statspack uses new v$views (and new columns added to 
existing v$views) introduced in this server release.


10.1.5. Using Statspack shipped with 9.0

The Statspack scripts shipped with 9.0 can not be used with any release
earlier than 9.0, as the 9.2 release uses new v$views (and new columns added 
to existing v$views) introduced in this server release.


10.1.6. Using Statspack shipped with 8.1.7 on 9i releases

It is not possible to use the Statspack shipped with 8.1.7 with any 9i
instance, due to the definition of an undocumented view Statspack 8i used,
changing between Oracle8i and Oracle9i.  Attempting to use 8.1 Statspack 
on an instance running 9i will result in package compilation errors.


10.2.  Upgrading an existing Statspack schema to a newer release

Scripts are provided which convert performance data in an existing 
Statspack schema running an older Statspack release, to the newer schema
format.

Although data conversion is not a supported activity, these scripts have been 
provided as a convenient way of keeping previously captured Statspack data.

Due to the differences in schema layout, minor irregularities may result 
in statistics captured before conversion.  An example of this is the 
Enqueue statistics data migration: do not compare Enqueue statistics data 
collected pre-10.1 to the Enqueue statistics data captured in 10.1 (for more 
details, see section 'Upgrading the Statspack schema from 9.2 to 10.1').


Backups
~~~~~~~
Note: There is no downgrade script.  Backup the PERFSTAT schema using
      export BEFORE attempting the upgrade, in case the upgrade fails.
      The only method of downgrading, or re-running the upgrade is to 
      de-install Statspack, and import a previously made export.

Before running the upgrade script, export the Statspack schema (for a
backup), then disable any scripts which use Statspack, as these will 
interfere with the upgrade.  For example, if you use a dbms_job to 
gather statistics, disable this job for the duration of the upgrade.


Data Volumes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there is a large volume of data in the Statspack schema (i.e. a large 
number of snapshots), to avoid a long upgrade time or avoid an unsuccessful 
upgrade:
 - ensure there is enough free space in PERFSTAT's default tablespace
   before starting the upgrade (each individual upgrade section will 
   describe how to estimate the required disk space)
 - if you do not use Automatic Undo Management, ensure you specify a large 
   rollback segment, if prompted
 - if you do not use Automatic Memory Management, ensure you specify a large 
   sort_area_size (e.g. 1048576), if prompted



Rollback segment errors during upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If it is required, the upgrade script will prompt you for the rollback segment
and sort_area_size to be used on your site.  If you do not need to specify a 
rollback segment or sort_area_size (e.g. because you use Automatic Undo 
Management and PGA Aggregate Target) simply press return, and ignore the 
following errors appearing in the upgrade log file:

  alter session set sort_area_size =
                                  *
  ERROR at line 1:
  ORA-02017: integer value required


  set transaction use rollback segment
                                    *
  ERROR at line 1:
  ORA-02245: invalid ROLLBACK SEGMENT name
  

Package Compilation errors during upgrade over multiple releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Errors in compiling the STATSPACK *package body* *while in the process* of 
running multiple Statspack upgrade scripts consecutively (e.g. when 
upgrading multiple releases) should be ignored.

If your site is upgrading from (for example) 9.0 to 10.1 and has 10.1 
installed, to upgrade the Statspack schema from 9.0 to 10.1, spup90.sql 
followed by spup92.sql must be run.

The Statspack package compilation which is a part of the first upgrade
script (spup90.sql) will fail with errors; this is expected, as the schema 
is in a partially upgraded state, and will not be fully upgraded to 10.1 until
spup92.sql is also run.

The final package compilation which is run as a part of the last upgrade 
script (in this case spup92.sql), must complete successfully.

Note:  The above example is not specific for the 9.0 to 10.1 upgrade, 
       it applies equally when upgrading Statspack through multiple 
       releases, no matter which releases.  


10.2.1. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 11.1   to 11.2

   Follow the general instructions in section 10.2. 'Upgrading an existing 
   Statspack schema to a newer release' above.

   To upgrade:
     - ensure you have sufficient free space in the tablespace
     - disable any programs which use Statspack
     - backup the Statspack schema (e.g. using export)
     - run the upgrade by connecting as a user with SYSDBA privilege:
    SQL>  connect / as sysdba
    SQL>  @spup1101

Once the upgrade script completes, check the log files (spup1101a.lis and
spup1101b.lis) for errors.  If errors are evident, determine and rectify the 
cause.  If no errors are evident, re-enable any Statspack data 
collection or reporting scripts which were previously disabled.

   To upgrade from 11.2.0.1 to 11.2.0.2
     - ensure you have sufficient free space in the tablespace
     - disable any programs which use Statspack
     - backup the Statspack schema (e.g. using export)
     - run the upgrade by connecting as a user with SYSDBA privilege:
    SQL>  connect / as sysdba
    SQL>  @spup11201

Once the upgrade script completes, check the log files (spup11201a.lis and
spup11201b.lis) for errors.  If errors are evident, determine and rectify the 
cause.  If no errors are evident, re-enable any Statspack data 
collection or reporting scripts which were previously disabled.


10.2.2. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 10.2   to 11.1

   Follow the general instructions in section 10.2. 'Upgrading an existing 
   Statspack schema to a newer release' above.

   To upgrade:
     - ensure you have sufficient free space in the tablespace
     - disable any programs which use Statspack
     - backup the Statspack schema (e.g. using export)
     - run the upgrade by connecting as a user with SYSDBA privilege:
    SQL>  connect / as sysdba
    SQL>  @spup102

Once the upgrade script completes, check the log files (spup102a.lis and
spup102b.lis) for errors.  If errors are evident, determine and rectify the 
cause.  If no errors are evident, re-enable any Statspack data 
collection or reporting scripts which were previously disabled.


10.2.3. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 10.1   to 10.2

   Follow the general instructions in section 10.2. 'Upgrading an existing 
   Statspack schema to a newer release' above.

   To upgrade:
     - ensure you have sufficient free space in the tablespace
     - disable any programs which use Statspack
     - backup the Statspack schema (e.g. using export)
     - run the upgrade by connecting as a user with SYSDBA privilege:
    SQL>  connect / as sysdba
    SQL>  @spup10

Once the upgrade script completes, check the log files (spup10a.lis and
spup10b.lis) for errors.  If errors are evident, determine and rectify the 
cause.  If no errors are evident, re-enable any Statspack data 
collection or reporting scripts which were previously disabled.


10.2.4. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 9.2   to 10.1

   Follow the general instructions in section 10.2. 'Upgrading an existing 
   Statspack schema to a newer release' above.

   This release creates new tables and indexes, and requires approx.
   20 extra MB.

   To upgrade:
     - ensure you have sufficient free space in the tablespace
     - disable any programs which use Statspack
     - backup the Statspack schema (e.g. using export)
     - run the upgrade by connecting as a user with SYSDBA privilege:
    SQL>  connect / as sysdba
    SQL>  @spup92

Once the upgrade script completes, check the log files (spup92a.lis and
spup92b.lis) for errors.  If errors are evident, determine and rectify the 
cause.  If no errors are evident, re-enable any Statspack data 
collection or reporting scripts which were previously disabled.


  Data Compatibility - 'enqueue' wait event
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Note that in 10.1, each enqueue has it's own distinct wait event, and the
  general 'enqueue' wait event will no longer be used.  Instead of seeing 
  'enqueue' as a wait event, you will now see 'enqueue: enqueue name - 
  request reason'
  e.g.
       enqueue: Transaction - row lock contention


  Data Compatibility - 'latch free' wait event
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Note that in 10.1, many latches each have their distinct wait event.  The
  general 'latch free' wait event is still used, but only represents data
  for those latches which do not have their own event.  So it is now possible
  to see 'latch free' as well as 'latch: <latch name>' in the list of
  wait events
  e.g. 
          latch: cache buffers chains
          latch free


  Data Compatibility - Enqueue Statistics
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A new v$view has been added in 10.1 - v$enqueue_statistics.  This view
  differs from the existing v$enqueue_stat view, as in addition to breaking
  down enqueue activity by enqueue Type, it also breaks down enqueue requests
  by Request Reason.  So for enqueues which can be requested for multiple 
  purposes, the data is broken down by reason.

  e.g. TX enqueue (transaction enqueue) can be requested for multiple reasons.

       In 10.1 the data may look like:
         Enqueue Type (Request Reason)              Requests
         -----------------------------------   -------------
         TX-Transaction (row lock contention)             55
         TX-Transaction (allocate ITL entry)               1

       Whereas in 9.2 the data would look like:
         Enqueue Type                               Requests
         -----------------------------------   -------------
         TX                                               56

  Statspack has been enhanced to use the new v$enqueue_statistics view, rather
  than continue using v$enqueue_stat.
  The Statspack upgrade script spup92.sql migrates the data captured from
  prior releases into the new format, in order to avoid losing historical data.

  Note for the reasons explained in the example above, you must sum up the
  enqueue statistics by Type in a 10.1 Statspack report, to be able to 
  make the equivalent comparison to the data shown in a 9.2 report.


  Data Compatibility - Changing of RAC Statistics and Event Names
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Real Application Cluster Event Names and Statistics have been changed
  from 'global cache xxx' to 'gc xxx'.  Historical performance data stored
  in the Statspack schema has not been modified to reflect the new names,
  so when comparing a Statspack report on a pre-10g system, be aware the
  statistic names and event names may have changed.


  Data Compatibility - Changing SQL Hash Value, and new SQL Id
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The computed value of the Hash Value column in the V$SQL family of tables 
  (v$sql, v$sqlarea, v$sqltext etc) has changed in release 10g.  This means the
  same SQL statement will have a different hash_value in 10g than in prior
  releases.  This change has been made as a consequence of introducing the
  new SQL Id column.  SQL Id can be considered a 'more unique' hash_value.
  The new SQL Id has been introduced to further reduce the probability of a 
  'hash collision' where two distinct SQL statements hash to the same
  hash_number.
  Statspack captures SQL Id, but does not use it as the unique identifier.
  Instead, Statspack continues to use the hash_value and first 31 bytes of the
  SQL text to uniquely identify a SQL statement (AWR uses SQL Id).



10.2.5. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 9.0   to 9.2

   Follow the general instructions in section 10.2. 'Upgrading an existing 
   Statspack schema to a newer release' above.

   This release creates new tables and indexes, and requires approx.
   20 extra MB.

   To upgrade:
     - ensure you have sufficient free space in the tablespace
     - disable any programs which use Statspack
     - backup the Statspack schema (e.g. using export)
     - run the upgrade by connecting as a user with SYSDBA privilege:
    SQL>  connect / as sysdba
    SQL>  @spup90

Once the upgrade script completes, check the log files (spup90a.lis and
spup90b.lis) for errors.  If errors are evident, determine and rectify the 
cause.  If no errors are evident, re-enable any Statspack data 
collection or reporting scripts which were previously disabled.


  SQL Plan Usage Data Upgrade note:
    If there is more than one database in a single Statspack schema (i.e.
    there are multiple distinct dbid's), AND if Level 6 snapshots have 
    been taken using the 9.0 release Statspack, then the SQL plan usage 
    data will be saved, but will not be queried by the sprepsql.sql 
    SQL report (this is because during the data conversion, it will not
    be possible to identify which database first identified a plan
    usage).
    For more details see 'SQL Plan Usage capture changed' in the 'Changes 
    between 9.0 and 9.2' section of this document. 


10.2.6. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.7 to 9.0

   Follow the general instructions in section 10.2. 'Upgrading an existing 
   Statspack schema to a newer release' above.

   Then, to estimate whether you have sufficient free space to run this 
   upgrade, execute the following SQL statement while connected as PERFSTAT in 
   SQL*Plus:

     select 10 + (2*sum(bytes)/1024/1024) est_space_mb
       from dba_segments
      where segment_name in ('STATS$ENQUEUESTAT');

   The est_space_mb column will give you a guesstimate as to the required
   free space, in megabytes.

   To upgrade:
     - ensure you have sufficient free space in the tablespace
     - disable any programs which use Statspack
     - backup the Statspack schema (e.g. using export)
     - run the upgrade by connecting as a user with SYSDBA privilege:
    SQL>  connect / as sysdba
    SQL>  @spup817

Once the upgrade script completes, check the log files (spup817a.lis and
spup817b.lis) for errors.   If errors are evident, determine and rectify 
the cause before proceeding.  If no errors are evident, and you are upgrading
to 9.2, you may proceed with the upgrade.


  Data Compatibility
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Prior to release 9.0, the STATS$ENQUEUESTAT table gathered data based on
  an X$ table, rather than a V$view.  In 9.0, the column data within the 
  underlying X$ table has been considerably improved, and the data 
  externalised via the V$ENQUEUE_STAT view.

  The Statspack upgrade script spup817.sql migrates the data captured from
  prior releases into the new format, in order to avoid losing historical data.

  Note however, that the column names and data contained within the columns
  has changed considerably between the two releases: the STATS$ENQUEUE_STAT 
  columns in 9.0 capture different data to the columns which existed in the
  STATS$ENQUEUESTAT table in the 8.1. Statspack releases.

  The column data migration performed by spup817.sql is as follows:

      8.1 STATS$ENQUEUESTAT   9.0 STATS$ENQUEUE_STAT
      ---------------------   ----------------------
      GETS                    TOTAL_REQ#
      WAITS                   TOTAL_WAIT#


  To further emphasise the difference, the column definitions appear below:

      STATS$ENQUEUESTAT.GETS         - 8.1
      Reflected the number of enqueue gets, excluding enqueue conversions.
      This statistic was incremented at the end of a get.

      STATS$ENQUEUE_STAT.TOTAL_REQ#  - 9.0
      Is the total number of requests for an enqueue + the number of
      enqueue conversions.  This statistic is incremented at the beginning 
      of a get request.

      STATS$ENQUEUESTAT.WAITS        - 8.1
      Reflected the number of times a session waited for at least 3 
      seconds for an enqueue operation (get or convert).  The statistic 
      was incremented at the end of the wait (either if the enqueue was 
      successfully gotten or if the request timed out).  If a session waited
      for less than 3 seconds, this statistic was not incremented.

      STATS$ENQUEUE_STAT.TOTAL_WAIT# - 9.0
      Is the total number of times a session waited for any enqueue operation.
      This statistic is incremented at the beginning of the wait.

  For these reasons it is not valid to compare Enqueue statistics data 
  collected pre-9.0, to Enqueue statistics data captured in Oracle9i.


10.2.7. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.6 to 8.1.7

   Follow the general instructions in section 10.2. 'Upgrading an existing 
   Statspack schema to a newer release' above.

   Then, to estimate whether you have sufficient free space to run this 
   upgrade, execute the following SQL statement while connected as PERFSTAT in 
   SQL*Plus:

     select 1.3*sum(bytes)/1024/1024 est_space_mb
       from dba_segments
      where segment_name in ('STATS$SQL_SUMMARY','STATS$SQL_SUMMARY_PK');
   The est_space_mb column will give you a guesstimate as to the required
   free space, in megabytes.
   The larger the SQL statements in the sql_summary table, the more space will
   be released after the upgrade is complete.

   To upgrade:
     - ensure you have sufficient free space in the tablespace
     - disable any programs which use Statspack
     - backup the Statspack schema (e.g. using export)
     - run the upgrade by connecting as a user with SYSDBA privilege:
    SQL>  connect / as sysdba
    SQL>  @spup816

Once the upgrade script completes, check the log files (spup816a.lis and 
spup816b.lis) for errors.  If errors are evident, determine and rectify 
the cause before proceeding.  If no errors are evident, and you are upgrading
to 9.0, you may proceed with the upgrade.


10.2.8. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.6 to 9.2

If you are running 8.1.6 Statspack and wish to upgrade to 9.2 Statspack, you 
must follow the upgrade steps - in the following order:
  - 10.2.4. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.6 to 8.1.7
  - 10.2.3. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.7 to 9.0
  - 10.2.2. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 9.0   to 9.2


10.2.9. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.6 to 9.0

If you are running 8.1.6 Statspack and wish to upgrade to 9.0 Statspack, you 
must follow the upgrade steps - in the following order:
  - 10.2.4. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.6 to 8.1.7
  - 10.2.3. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.7 to 9.0


10.2.10. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.7 to 9.2

If you are running 8.1.7 Statspack and wish to upgrade to 9.2 Statspack, you 
must follow the upgrade steps - in the following order:
  - 10.2.2. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 8.1.7 to 9.0
  - 10.2.1. Upgrading the Statspack schema from 9.0   to 9.2



11. Oracle Real Application Clusters specific considerations
------------------------------------------------------------

11.1. Changing Instance Numbers

The unique identifier for a database instance used by Statspack is the
dbid and the instance_number.  When in a Real Application Clusters environment,
it is possible the instance_number may change between startups (either 
because the instance_number initialization parameter is set, or 
because the instances are started in a different order).

In this case, as Statspack uses the instance_number and the dbid to identify
the instance's snapshot preferences, it is important to note that this may 
inadvertently result in a different set of levels or thresholds being
used when snapshotting an instance.

There are three conditions which must be met for this to occur:
 - the instance numbers must have switched between startups
 - the DBA must have modified the default Statspack parameters used for
   at least one of the instances
 - the parameters used (e.g. thresholds and snapshot level) must not be 
   the same on all instances

Note that the only way the parameters will differ is if the parameters
have been explicitly modified by the DBA after installation, either by
saving the specified values or by using the modify_statspack_parameter 
procedure.

It is easy to check whether any of the Statspack snapshot parameters are 
different for the instances by querying the STATS$STATSPACK_PARAMETER table.

  NOTE:
  If you have changed the default Statspack parameters you may
  wish to avoid encountering this problem by hard-coding the instance_number
  initialization parameter for each of the instances of a Clustered
  database - this will avoid encountering this problem.
  For recommendations and issues with setting the instance_number 
  initialization parameter, please see the Real Application Clusters 
  documentation.


11.2. Real Application Clusters Specific Reports

sprepins.sql
  sprepins.sql can be run to query performance data for any instance which the 
  PERFSTAT schema contains.  The report will prompt for a dbid,
  instance_number and begin and end snap id's.

  This report can be used when importing data from another instance, or in a 
  Real Application Clusters environment to report on an instance which you are 
  not connected to.

  For more information on sprepins.sql, see the 'Running the instance report 
  when there are multiple instances' section of this document.

sprsqins.sql
    sprsqins.sql can be run to query SQL performance data for any instance 
    which the  PERFSTAT schema contains.  The report will prompt for a dbid,
    instance_number, begin and end snap id's, and hash value.

    This report can be used when importing data from another instance, or in a 
    Real Application Clusters environment to report on an instance which you 
    are not connected to.

    For more information on sprsqins.sql, see the 'Running the SQL report 
    when there are multiple instances' section of this document.


11.3 Real Application Clusters Specific Data

New Real Application Clusters specific data displayed in Statspack instance 
report:

- Page 2 of the Statspack report for a RAC instance displays RAC specific 
  derived statistics.
- RAC segment statistics 
- RAC-specific data for Library Cache and Dictionary Cache
- Global Enqueue Statistics from v$ges_statistics
- Global CR Served Statistics
- Global CURRENT Served Statistics
- Global Cache Transfer Statistics 


12.  Conflicts and differences compared to UTLBSTAT/UTLESTAT
------------------------------------------------------------

12.1. Running BSTAT/ESTAT in conjunction to Statspack

If you choose to run BSTAT/ESTAT in conjunction to Statspack, do not do 
run both as the same user, as there is a table name conflict - this table 
is stats$waitstat.


12.2. Differences between Statspack and BSTAT/ESTAT

Statspack considers a transaction to either finish with a commit or a
rollback, and so calculates the number of transactions thus:
  'user commits' + 'user rollbacks'

BSTAT/ESTAT considers a transaction to complete with a commit only, and
so assumes that transactions = 'user commits'

For this reason, comparing per transaction statistics between Statspack and
BSTAT/ESTAT may result in significantly different per transaction ratios.



13.  Removing the package
-------------------------

To deinstall the package, connect as a user with SYSDBA privilege and run 
the following script from SQL*Plus:  spdrop
  e.g.
      SQL>  connect / as sysdba
      SQL>  @spdrop

This script actually calls 2 other scripts:
      1.  spdtab  ->  Drops tables and public synonyms
      2.  spdusr  ->  Drops the user

Check each of the two output files produced (spdtab.lis, spdusr.lis) 
to ensure the package was completely deinstalled.

15.  Limitations and Modifications
----------------------------------

15.1.  Limitations

  As the Statspack schema is updated to reflect the features in the
  latest Oracle releases, the schema may change; backward compatibility 
  is not guaranteed.


15.2.  Modifications

  All Statspack code is Oracle proprietary and must not be modified.  Any 
  modifications made to Statspack software will render the code and
  data captured thereafter unsupported; unsupported changes may result in 
  errors in data capture or reporting.  Instead, please request enhancements.
